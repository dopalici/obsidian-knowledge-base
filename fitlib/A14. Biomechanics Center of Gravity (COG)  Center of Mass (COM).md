The Center of Gravity (COG) or Center of Mass (COM) is the theoretical point where the entire weight/mass of an object or body is considered to be concentrated.

\- \*\*Location:\*\* In humans, typically around the S2 vertebra level when standing anatomically, but its exact location changes constantly with body position and limb movement. Can even be located outside the body (e.g., during a high jump arch).  
\- \*\*Base of Support (BOS):\*\* The area enclosed by the points of contact between the body and the supporting surface.  
\- \*\*Stability:\*\* An object/body is stable when its COG is positioned vertically above its BOS. Stability increases with:  
    \- Lower COG height.  
    \- Larger BOS area.  
    \- COG positioned more centrally within the BOS.  
    \- Greater body mass.  
\- \*\*Movement Initiation:\*\* To initiate movement (e.g., walking), the COG must be shifted outside the BOS, creating instability that requires a corrective step.

\*\*Implications:\*\* COG and BOS relationship is fundamental to balance and stability (\[\[L3-BALANCE-COORDINATION\]\]). Exercise technique often involves manipulating COG relative to BOS for stability (e.g., wide stance in squat) or controlled instability (e.g., lunges, single-leg exercises). Understanding COG helps analyze lifting mechanics and fall risk.
