### **EXL-25: Dumbbell Front Raise**

**ID:** EXL-25-DB-FRONTRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise involving raising dumbbells straight forward to shoulder height. Primarily targets the anterior (front) head of the deltoid muscle.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Alternating Dumbbell Front Raise.
- Cable Front Raise [[EXL-72 Cable Front Raise]].
- Barbell Front Raise.
- Incline Dumbbell Front Raise (increases stretch).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Front Raise [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pressing exercises (Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]], [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]], Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]], [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]]) which heavily involve the anterior deltoid.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Medial Deltoid, Serratus Anterior, Biceps Brachii (short head).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Trapezius, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand or sit upright, core engaged. Hold dumbbells in front of thighs with overhand (pronated) or neutral grip, arms nearly straight (slight elbow bend).
- **Execution:** Keeping arms straight (slight elbow bend constant), exhale and raise one or both dumbbells directly forward and upward until arm(s) are approximately parallel to the floor (shoulder height). Avoid using momentum or leaning back. Control the descent, inhaling as you slowly lower dumbbell(s) back to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/body swing, excessive leaning back, bending elbows significantly during the raise, raising weight too high (engaging traps more), uncontrolled lowering.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues, biceps tendinopathy). Can aggravate anterior shoulder pain if performed improperly.
- **Safety:** Use strict form, minimize momentum. Control the weight, especially the eccentric. Avoid excessive shrugging.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load with strict form.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, controlled movement, stable torso) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
