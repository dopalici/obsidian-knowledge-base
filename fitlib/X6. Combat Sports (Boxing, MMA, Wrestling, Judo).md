Combat sports encompass a diverse range of disciplines requiring complex combinations of physical capacities including high levels of strength, power, anaerobic/aerobic endurance, agility, flexibility, and specific technical skills.

\*\*Key Physical Demands (Vary by Sport):\*\*  
\- \*\*High-Intensity Intermittent Endurance:\*\* Ability to perform repeated bursts of maximal or near-maximal effort (striking combinations, takedown attempts, grappling exchanges) with short recovery periods. Requires excellent anaerobic capacity (\[\[A6-ENERGY-SYSTEMS\]\]) and aerobic fitness (\[\[E1-AEROBIC-ANAEROBIC\]\]) for recovery between efforts.  
\- \*\*Strength & Power:\*\*  
    \- \*Striking Power (Boxing, MMA):\* Explosive force generation through kinetic chain (legs, core, upper body).  
    \- \*Grappling Strength (Wrestling, Judo, BJJ, MMA):\* High levels of isometric and dynamic strength (pulling, pushing, gripping, core stability) to control opponents. Maximal strength important.  
    \- \*Takedown Power:\* Explosive lower body and core power.  
\- \*\*Muscular Endurance:\*\* Ability to sustain force output during prolonged grappling exchanges or repeated striking flurries.  
\- \*\*Agility & Footwork:\*\* Rapid changes of direction, maintaining balance during offensive/defensive maneuvers.  
\- \*\*Flexibility & Mobility:\*\* Required for specific techniques (e.g., high kicks, grappling positions, submission defense \- \[\[L2-MOBILITY-FLEXIBILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Core Strength & Stability:\*\* Essential for power transfer, resisting opponent's force, maintaining posture during grappling (\[\[L4-CORE-STABILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Neck Strength:\*\* Important for injury prevention (whiplash from strikes, resisting chokes).  
\- \*\*Weight Management:\*\* Many combat sports involve weight classes, requiring disciplined nutritional strategies for making weight safely while preserving performance (\[\[D-WEIGHT-MANAGEMENT\]\], \[\[C26-NUTRITION-FAT-LOSS\]\]). Rapid weight cutting common but carries risks.

\*\*Training Components:\*\*  
\- \*\*Sport-Specific Technical Training:\*\* Drilling techniques (striking, grappling, throws, submissions) with partners, bags, pads. Sparring.  
\- \*\*Conditioning:\*\* High-intensity interval training (HIIT \- \[\[E3-HIIT\]\]), circuit training (\[\[B18-CIRCUIT-TRAINING\]\]), roadwork (running \- \[\[E6-RUNNING\]\]), metabolic conditioning (metcons) mimicking fight pace/duration. Strong aerobic base aids recovery.  
\- \*\*Strength Training:\*\* Focus on compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, pull-ups), loaded carries (\[\[L1-MOVEMENT-PATTERNS\]\]), grip strength work. Periodized approach balancing strength and conditioning (\[\[O1-INTEGRATED-PROGRAMMING\]\]).  
\- \*\*Power Training:\*\* Olympic lift variations, plyometrics, medicine ball throws, kettlebell work (\[\[B15-OLYMPIC-WEIGHTLIFTING\]\], \[\[B9-KETTLEBELL-TRAINING\]\]).  
\- \*\*Neck Strengthening Exercises.\*\*  
\- \*\*Mobility & Flexibility Work.\*\*

\*\*Nutrition & Weight Management:\*\* Requires careful planning to fuel intense training, support recovery, and make weight safely if applicable. Dehydration from rapid weight cuts severely impacts performance and health. Post-weigh-in rehydration/re-fueling strategies critical (\[\[C4-HYDRATION\]\], \[\[C5-ELECTROLYTES\]\]).

\*\*Common Injuries:\*\* Concussions, facial/hand fractures (striking sports), shoulder dislocations/instability, knee ligament injuries (esp. wrestling/judo/MMA), cauliflower ear (grappling), skin infections, neck injuries, LBP.
