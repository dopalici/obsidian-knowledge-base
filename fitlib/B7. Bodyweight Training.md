### B7. Bodyweight Training
**ID:** B7-BODYWEIGHT-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Bodyweight training (calisthenics) utilizes the individual's own body mass as the primary source of resistance. It is a highly accessible, versatile, and effective method for developing foundational strength, movement competency, stability, and muscular endurance.

**Benefits:**
- **Accessibility & Cost:** Requires minimal or no equipment, can be performed virtually anywhere. Low barrier to entry.
- **Fundamental Movement Mastery:** Excellent for learning and refining basic human movement patterns ([[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]) like squatting, lunging, pushing, pulling, hinging, bracing.
- **Relative Strength:** Directly improves strength relative to one's own body weight, a key component of athleticism and functional capacity.
- **Kinesthetic Awareness & Proprioception:** Enhances body awareness, balance ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]), and control due to the need to stabilize the entire body during movements.
- **Core Engagement:** Many bodyweight exercises inherently require significant core activation for stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- **Scalability:** Exercises can be regressed (made easier) or progressed (made harder) through numerous methods without needing external weights initially.

**Basic Exercises & Progressions:**
- **Squats:** Bodyweight Squat -> Paused Squat -> Jump Squat -> Pistol Squat (Single Leg).
- **Push-ups:** Incline -> Knee -> Standard -> Decline -> Plyometric -> Archer/One-Arm variations.
- **Pulling:** Inverted Rows (various angles) -> Band Assisted Pull-ups -> Pull-ups/Chin-ups -> Weighted/Archer/One-Arm variations.
- **Lunges:** Static -> Walking -> Reverse -> Lateral -> Jumping Lunges.
- **Hinges:** Glute Bridge -> Single Leg Glute Bridge -> Bodyweight Good Morning -> Single Leg RDL (bodyweight).
- **Core:** Plank -> Side Plank -> Bird Dog -> Hollow Body Hold -> Leg Raises -> Dragon Flag / Levers.

**Progression Methods (Beyond Basic Exercise Variation):**
- **Leverage:** Adjusting body position relative to gravity or pivot points (e.g., incline vs. decline push-ups).
- **Range of Motion:** Increasing the depth or amplitude of movement.
- **Unilateral Training:** Shifting load to a single limb increases demand significantly.
- **Tempo Control:** Slowing down eccentrics/concentrics, adding pauses increases time under tension.
- **Volume/Density:** Increasing reps, sets, or decreasing rest.
- **Instability:** Using rings, suspension trainers ([[B12. Suspension Training (TRX)]]), or unstable surfaces (use purposefully).
- **Adding External Load:** Progressing to weighted vests, dip belts, or holding weights once bodyweight mastery achieved.

**Advanced Calisthenics/Gymnastics:** Skills like planches, levers, handstand push-ups, muscle-ups represent high levels of relative strength and control ([[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]]).

**Limitations:** Maximal strength/hypertrophy potential may be limited compared to heavy free weight training for advanced individuals due to challenges in applying sufficient progressive overload via bodyweight alone.
