### **EXL-65: Assisted Pull-up/Dip Machine**

**ID:** EXL-65-MEX-ASSISTPULLDIP **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine [[B10. Machine Training]] that provides adjustable counterweight assistance to reduce the effective bodyweight lifted during pull-ups/chin-ups or dips, making these challenging bodyweight exercises accessible to individuals not yet strong enough to perform them unassisted.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (depending on assistance level).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Decrease Assistance (reduce counterweight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pauses).
- Transition to Band Assisted Pull-ups/Dips [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Transition to Negative Pull-ups/Dips (eccentric only).
- Progress to unassisted Bodyweight Pull-ups/Chin-ups [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]] or Dips [[EXL-82 Dip (Parallel Bar)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Increase Assistance (more counterweight).
- Lat Pulldowns [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]] (for pull-up pattern).
- Triceps Extensions [[EXL-59 Triceps Extension (Machine - Overhead or Pushdown type)]]Triceps Pushdowns [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]] (for dip pattern).
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].

**Target Muscles (Pull-up Assist):**

- **Primary Movers:** Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major, Biceps Brachii. (See [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]] for more detail). **Target Muscles (Dip Assist):**
- **Primary Movers:** Pectoralis Major (lower), Triceps Brachii, Anterior Deltoid. (See [[EXL-82 Dip (Parallel Bar)]] for more detail). **Stabilizers (Both):** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Select desired assistance weight (more weight = more assistance = easier). Place knees or feet securely on the assistance platform. Grasp pull-up or dip handles with appropriate grip.
- **Execution (Pull-up Assist):** Follow pull-up form cues [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]]: start from hang, initiate with scapular depression/retraction, pull chest towards bar until chin clears, lower under control to full extension. Machine assistance helps on the way up.
- **Execution (Dip Assist):** Follow dip form cues [[EXL-82 Dip (Parallel Bar)]]: start with arms extended, lower body by bending elbows (keeping them tucked) until upper arms are near parallel to floor (or comfortable depth), press back up to full extension. Machine assistance helps on the way up.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during exertion (pulling up/pressing up), inhale during lowering/return.
- **Common Faults:** Similar to unassisted versions but often masked by assistance; relying too heavily on assistance, incomplete range of motion, poor scapular control.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Follow contraindications for unassisted pull-ups/dips.
- **Safety:** Ensure secure placement on assistance pad. Select appropriate assistance level allowing good form through full ROM. Control the movement, don't allow pad to push up too quickly.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Assistance weight used for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed at a given assistance level.
- Progress towards less assistance or unassisted reps.
- Qualitative assessment of form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
