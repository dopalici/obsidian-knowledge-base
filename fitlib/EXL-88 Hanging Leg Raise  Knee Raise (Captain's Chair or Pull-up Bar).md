### **EXL-88: Hanging Leg Raise / Knee Raise (Captain's Chair or Pull-up Bar)**

**ID:** EXL-88-BW-LEGRAISE-HANGING **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A challenging core exercise [[L4. Core Stability Training]] targeting the lower rectus abdominis and hip flexors. Performed by hanging from a pull-up bar [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]] or supported by forearms in a Captain's Chair apparatus [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]], involving raising the knees or straight legs towards the torso.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Knee Raise) to Advanced (Straight Leg Raise).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Straighten Legs (Hanging Straight Leg Raise - increases lever arm).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add Ankle Weights [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at top).
- Toes-to-Bar (Gymnastics movement [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]]).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Perform Knee Raises instead of Straight Leg Raises.
- Use Captain's Chair (provides upper body support).
- Perform Lying Leg Raises (floor supported).
- Reverse Crunches.
- Planks [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]] and variations.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Rectus Abdominis (especially lower portion), Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas, Rectus Femoris, Sartorius, TFL).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Obliques.
- **Stabilizers:** Forearm flexors/Grip muscles (hanging), Latissimus Dorsi, Scapular stabilizers, Core musculature (resisting swing) [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Hanging):** Grip pull-up bar with overhand grip, shoulder-width apart. Hang with arms fully extended. Engage shoulders slightly (slight depression/retraction, avoid passive dead hang). Keep legs straight or slightly bent initially.
- **Setup (Captain's Chair):** Position forearms securely on pads, back against backrest. Grip handles lightly. Let legs hang straight down.
- **Execution (Knee Raise):** Exhale and raise knees towards chest by flexing hips and tilting pelvis posteriorly (slight crunching motion). Focus on using lower abdominals. Avoid excessive swinging/momentum.
- **Execution (Leg Raise):** Keeping legs relatively straight (slight knee bend okay), exhale and raise legs upwards towards torso, aiming for parallel to floor or higher if possible, using abdominals and hip flexors. Control the descent, inhaling as you slowly lower legs back to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Excessive swinging/using momentum, insufficient range of motion, arching lower back (especially during lowering), pulling primarily with hip flexors without engaging abs.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back pain (especially with hip flexor tightness), shoulder impingement/instability (hanging version). Grip strength can be limiting factor for hanging variation.
- **Safety:** Control the movement, minimize swinging. Focus on core engagement. Start with knee raises before progressing to straight leg raises.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Ability to perform straight leg vs. knee raise.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal swing, controlled movement, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
