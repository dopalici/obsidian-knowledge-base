### **EXL-79: Cable Pull-Through**

**ID:** EXL-79-CEX-PULLTHROUGH **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A hip hinge exercise [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] and typically a rope attachment. Involves pulling the cable between the legs while extending the hips, primarily targeting the glutes and hamstrings. Often used as a hip hinge teaching tool or glute accessory.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Strong glute squeeze at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Progress to Kettlebell Swings [[B9. Kettlebell Training]].
- Progress to Romanian Deadlifts [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] / [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].
- Progress to Hip Thrusts [[EXL-07 Barbell Hip Thrust]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Resistance Band Pull-Throughs [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on bodyweight hip hinge practice [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Erector Spinae (isometric).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Feet/Ankles.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach a rope handle to a low pulley cable. Stand facing away from machine, straddling the cable. Reach down between legs and grasp rope ends with neutral grip. Step forward until there is tension on cable. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Hinge forward at hips, keeping back straight (neutral spine), allowing rope handle to travel back between legs.
- **Execution:** Initiate movement by driving hips forward forcefully, extending hips and knees to stand tall. Squeeze glutes hard at the top/lockout position. Keep arms relatively straight throughout (they act as levers). Control the eccentric phase, hinging back at the hips slowly, allowing rope to travel back between legs while maintaining neutral spine. Feel stretch in hamstrings.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during forward hip thrust (concentric), inhale during backward hinge (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rounding lower back, initiating movement by pulling with arms or extending back, squatting instead of hinging, incomplete hip extension/glute squeeze at top.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or hamstring injuries. Requires ability to perform hip hinge with neutral spine.
- **Safety:** Prioritize hip hinge pattern and neutral spine. Focus on glute contraction at top. Control the movement. Start with light weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip hinge quality, spinal neutrality, glute squeeze) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
