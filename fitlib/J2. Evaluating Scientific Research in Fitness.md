### J2. Evaluating Scientific Research in Fitness
**ID:** J2-SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH
**Created:** 2025-04-25

Critically evaluating scientific research is essential for discerning evidence-based practices from misinformation in the fitness industry. Understanding research methodology and potential biases allows for informed decision-making.

**Hierarchy of Evidence (General Guide, Highest to Lowest Quality):**
1.  Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses (of high-quality RCTs).
2.  Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).
3.  Cohort Studies.
4.  Case-Control Studies.
5.  Cross-Sectional Studies.
6.  Case Series / Case Reports.
7.  Expert Opinion / Anecdotes / Mechanistic Reasoning.

**Critical Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Study Design:** Appropriate for question?
- **Population Studied (Sample):** Generalizable? Sample size adequate?
- **Intervention & Control Groups:** Clearly defined? Appropriate comparison? Randomization/blinding?
- **Outcome Measures:** Relevant, valid, reliable?
- **Statistical Analysis:** Appropriate? Statistical vs. practical significance? Confidence intervals?
- **Results & Interpretation:** Conclusions match results? Limitations acknowledged?
- **Funding & Conflicts of Interest:** Potential bias?
- **Peer Review:** Published in reputable journal?

**Common Issues in Fitness Research:** Small samples, short durations, untrained subjects, inadequate controls, industry bias, surrogate markers vs. meaningful outcomes.
