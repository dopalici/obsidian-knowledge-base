# E14. Concurrent Training: Updated Protocols & Considerations

## Conceptual Overview

Concurrent training (CT) involves performing both resistance [[B. Resistance Training]] and endurance [[E. Cardiovascular  Endurance Training]] exercise within the same training program, often within the same session or on the same day. While CT is effective for simultaneously improving multiple fitness qualities (cardiovascular health, strength, hypertrophy), potential "interference effects" exist where adaptations to one mode may be blunted by the other, particularly strength/power adaptations potentially being compromised by high-volume/intensity endurance training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]].

## Theoretical Foundations (Interference Mechanisms)

- **Molecular Signaling Pathway Conflict:** Key pathways mediating endurance adaptations (e.g., AMPK activation [[A29. Tissue Adaptation to Exercise (Molecular & Cellular)]]) can potentially inhibit pathways mediating resistance training adaptations (e.g., mTORC1 signaling [[A29. Tissue Adaptation to Exercise (Molecular & Cellular)]]), particularly when stimuli are performed in close proximity.
- **Residual Fatigue:** Fatigue (central or peripheral) from one training mode may impair performance or stimulus quality in the subsequent mode.
- **Overtraining Risk:** Combining high volumes of both modes increases total stress, potentially exceeding recovery capacity [[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]].
- **Fiber Type Conversion:** Theoretically, high-volume endurance training could promote shifts towards more oxidative fiber types, potentially limiting maximal power/hypertrophy [[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]].

## Practical Applications & Programming Strategies to Mitigate Interference

- **Magnitude of Interference:** Interference primarily affects **power and hypertrophy** development, less so maximal strength, and generally does not negatively impact endurance adaptations. The effect is more pronounced with **higher volumes and intensities** of endurance training performed **concurrently** with resistance training.
- **Training Prioritization:** Prioritize the training mode most critical to the primary goal within the session (e.g., strength/power work before endurance work if strength is the priority).
- **Intra-Session Sequencing:** Performing resistance training _before_ endurance training within the same session generally results in less interference with strength/hypertrophy gains compared to the reverse order.
- **Recovery Time Between Sessions:** Separating resistance and endurance sessions by several hours (e.g., >6 hours) or ideally on different days allows molecular signaling pathways to return towards baseline, reducing direct interference.
- **Endurance Modality:** Cycling may cause less interference with lower body strength/hypertrophy compared to running, potentially due to less eccentric muscle damage [[B20. Eccentric Training]].
- **Endurance Intensity & Volume:** Limiting high-intensity endurance work (HIIT [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]]) immediately before or after heavy resistance training may be prudent. Keeping total endurance volume moderate can mitigate interference.
- **Nutrition:** Adequate energy [[A1. Energy Balance]] and protein intake [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]] are crucial to support adaptation to both stimuli.

## Research Support

- Numerous meta-analyses confirm the interference effect, particularly for lower body power and hypertrophy when running is combined with resistance training. Effects on strength are smaller and more variable.
- Studies support the benefits of separating sessions or performing resistance training first to minimize interference.
- Recent research continues to explore optimal programming variables (volume, intensity, frequency, modality, timing) to maximize adaptations in CT protocols.
- CT remains highly effective for improving overall health markers and functional capacity, particularly in general or clinical populations.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Optimal strategies depend heavily on individual goals, training status, recovery capacity, and specific program details.
- The practical significance of molecular interference in well-structured programs for many athletes/individuals is debated. Fatigue management might be a larger factor.
- Most research involves specific protocols; findings may not generalize perfectly to all CT variations.
