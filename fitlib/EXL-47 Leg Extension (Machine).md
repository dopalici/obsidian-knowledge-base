 ### **EXL-47: Leg Extension (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-47-MEX-LEGEXT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] involving extending the knee against resistance while seated. Primarily targets the quadriceps muscles.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Leg Leg Extension (addresses imbalances).
- Progress to compound exercises like Squats [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]], Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]], Leg Press [[EXL-46 Leg Press (Machine)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Squats [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] or Wall Sits [[B19. Isometrics]].
- Shortened Range of Motion (if needed due to pain/rehab).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps Femoris (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Tibialis Anterior (minor role in dorsiflexion stabilization).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hip Flexors (to maintain seated position).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust the machine back pad so knees are aligned with the machine's axis of rotation and back is fully supported. Adjust the lower leg pad so it rests comfortably on the lower shin/ankle area. Sit securely, holding handles for stability.
- **Execution:** Exhale and extend knees smoothly, raising the leg pad until legs are nearly straight (avoid forceful lockout). Focus on contracting the quadriceps. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position under control (eccentric phase), ensuring the weight stack doesn't touch down between reps to maintain tension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during knee extension (concentric), inhale during knee flexion (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum, lifting hips off the seat, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled lowering phase, forcefully locking out knees.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Certain knee conditions (e.g., some types of patellofemoral pain, post-ACL reconstruction - may require modification or avoidance based on professional advice). Can place shear forces on the knee joint.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper machine setup. Use appropriate weight that allows full control. Avoid hyperextending or forcefully locking the knees.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Time under tension.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
