### A3. Macronutrients
**ID:** A3-MACRONUTRIENTS
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Macronutrients provide energy and structural components. Needs vary based on goals, activity, individual factors.

**Protein:**
- Energy: ~4 kcal/gram.
- Functions: Building blocks (amino acids) for muscle (MPS), enzymes, hormones, immune cells, transport proteins. 9 Essential Amino Acids (EAAs) must be obtained from diet.
- TEF: Highest (~20-30%).
- Requirements: RDA 0.8g/kg (sedentary). Athletes/active individuals: 1.2-2.2g/kg/day recommended ([[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]). Higher needs during energy restriction (~1.8-2.7g/kg).
- Quality: Based on EAA content and digestibility (DIAAS score). Leucine (~2-3g) key trigger for MPS.

**Carbohydrates:**
- Energy: ~4 kcal/gram.
- Functions: Primary fuel for CNS and moderate-to-high intensity exercise. Stored as glycogen. Spares protein.
- TEF: Moderate (~5-10%).
- Requirements: Highly variable based on activity (3-12 g/kg/day). Includes dietary fiber (soluble/insoluble).
- Types: Simple (sugars) vs. Complex (starches, fiber).

**Fats:**
- Energy: ~9 kcal/gram.
- Functions: Energy store, cell membranes, hormone synthesis, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs): Omega-6 (Linoleic) and Omega-3 (ALA). EPA/DHA (from Omega-3) important.
- TEF: Lowest (~0-3%).
- Requirements: Generally 20-35% of total calories. Minimum intake needed (~0.5-0.6 g/kg). Limit trans fats; moderate saturated fats (<10% kcal). Focus on unsaturated fats.
