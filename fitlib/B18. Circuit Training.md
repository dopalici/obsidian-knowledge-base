### B18. Circuit Training
**ID:** B18-CIRCUIT-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Circuit training involves performing a series of exercises (typically 5-12) in sequence with minimal rest between exercises, followed by a longer rest period after completing one full circuit. Circuits are typically repeated multiple times.

**Design Variables:** Number of exercises, exercise selection (resistance, cardio, combo), work interval (time/reps), rest interval (between exercises - short; between circuits - longer), number of circuits.

**Benefits:**
- **Time Efficiency:** Combines strength and cardiovascular stimulus.
- **Cardiovascular Improvement:** Elevated heart rate provides aerobic benefit ([[E1. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Training]]).
- **Muscular Endurance:** High reps / short rest challenge local endurance ([[B13. Strength Training Goals (Max Strength, Power, Hypertrophy, Endurance)]]).
- **Caloric Expenditure:** Significant calorie burn during/after (EPOC).
- **Versatility:** Adaptable to various levels, goals, equipment.

**Limitations:** May not be optimal for maximizing maximal strength or hypertrophy due to fatigue limiting load/intensity compared to traditional structures.
