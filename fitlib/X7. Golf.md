Golf performance relies on a complex interplay of technical skill, mental focus, and specific physical capacities, particularly rotational power, stability, mobility, and endurance for walking the course.

\*\*Key Physical Demands:\*\*  
\- \*\*Rotational Power & Speed:\*\* Generating high clubhead speed through efficient sequencing of hip, trunk, and shoulder rotation (kinetic chain). Requires explosive power from lower body and core (\[\[B13-STRENGTH-TRAINING-GOALS\]\], \[\[L4-CORE-STABILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Mobility:\*\* Crucial for achieving optimal backswing range and efficient sequencing. Key areas: Thoracic spine rotation, hip rotation (internal/external), shoulder mobility (internal/external rotation, flexion) (\[\[L2-MOBILITY-FLEXIBILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Stability:\*\* Core stability needed to control rotation and transfer force efficiently. Hip and scapular stability required for controlled movement and injury prevention. Balance important (\[\[L3-BALANCE-COORDINATION\]\], \[\[L4-CORE-STABILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Strength:\*\* Foundational strength (legs, core, upper body) supports power generation and endurance. Grip strength important.  
\- \*\*Endurance:\*\* Cardiovascular fitness needed to walk the course (often 4-5+ miles) without excessive fatigue, which can degrade technique and focus (\[\[E1-AEROBIC-ANAEROBIC\]\]). Muscular endurance in legs/core.  
\- \*\*Asymmetry:\*\* The golf swing is a highly asymmetrical movement, potentially leading to muscle imbalances if not addressed through training.

\*\*Training Components:\*\*  
\- \*\*Strength Training:\*\* Focus on compound movements (squats, deadlifts, lunges), rotational exercises (medicine ball throws, cable woodchops), core stability work (anti-rotation, anti-lateral flexion), upper body push/pull for balance. Unilateral training beneficial.  
\- \*\*Power Development:\*\* Medicine ball work, rotational jumps/throws, kettlebell swings (\[\[B9-KETTLEBELL-TRAINING\]\]), potentially light implement training (e.g., speed sticks).  
\- \*\*Mobility & Flexibility:\*\* Specific drills targeting thoracic spine rotation, hip internal/external rotation, shoulder mobility, hamstring flexibility. Yoga or dedicated mobility routines often incorporated (\[\[L2-MOBILITY-FLEXIBILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Balance & Stability Training:\*\* Single-leg exercises, core stability drills.  
\- \*\*Cardiovascular Conditioning:\*\* Moderate intensity cardio (walking, cycling) to build endurance for walking the course.  
\- \*\*Technical Practice:\*\* Swing drills, range time, short game practice, playing rounds.

\*\*Nutrition & Hydration:\*\* Focus on maintaining energy levels and hydration throughout long rounds. Consistent fueling strategies important (\[\[C4-HYDRATION\]\], \[\[C27-NUTRITION-ENDURANCE\]\] \- principles apply).

\*\*Common Injuries (\[\[IX-1-COMMON-MSK-INJURIES\]\]):\*\* Lower back pain (due to rotational stress, poor mechanics, overuse), golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis), wrist injuries, shoulder pain (rotator cuff), hip issues. Often related to swing mechanics, overuse, or inadequate physical preparation (mobility/stability deficits).
