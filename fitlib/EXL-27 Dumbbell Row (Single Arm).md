### **EXL-27: Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)**

**ID:** EXL-27-DB-ROW-SA **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A unilateral upper-body pulling exercise performed typically with one knee and hand supporting the body on a bench, while rowing a dumbbell towards the torso with the opposite arm. Effectively targets back musculature (lats, rhomboids, traps) and promotes core anti-rotational stability.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Requires coordination and core stability to prevent torso rotation).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (e.g., pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Increase Range of Motion (allow greater scapular protraction at bottom).
- Variations: Kroc Rows (higher rep, controlled momentum variation), Three-Point Stance Row (hand on rack instead of bench).
- Progress to Barbell Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]] / [[EXL-18 Yates Row (Underhand Barbell Row)]] (bilateral, allows heavier load).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row [[EXL-28 Dumbbell Bench Supported Row (Chest Supported)]].
- Seated Cable Row [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]].
- Machine Row [[EXL-57 Seated Row (Machine - Close GripNeutral)]] / [[EXL-58 Chest Supported Row (Machine)]].
- Resistance Band Rows [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Bodyweight Inverted Rows [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (Middle), Rhomboids.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Core musculature (especially anti-rotation stabilizers like Obliques) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Glutes, Hamstrings (of support leg), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place one knee and the same-side hand firmly on a flat bench. Position other foot flat on floor, slightly out to the side for stable base. Maintain neutral spine (flat back) parallel or near-parallel to floor. Allow working arm to hang straight down holding dumbbell with neutral grip (palm facing body). Ensure non-working shoulder is stable.
- **Execution:** Initiate movement by retracting scapula (pulling shoulder blade towards spine). Pull the dumbbell upwards towards hip/lower rib cage, leading with the elbow. Keep elbow relatively close to body (don't flare out excessively). Focus on squeezing back muscles at the top. Avoid excessive torso rotation or using momentum/hip elevation. Lower dumbbell under control, allowing scapula to protract (move away from spine) at the bottom for full stretch.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during controlled lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive body English/momentum, rotating torso significantly, pulling with biceps rather than back, shrugging shoulder towards ear, rounding lower back, pulling dumbbell towards shoulder instead of hip.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or shoulder injuries. Requires careful execution to avoid straining lower back.
- **Safety:** Maintain neutral spine throughout. Control the weight. Ensure bench is stable. Avoid hyperextending shoulder at the bottom.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (spinal position, lack of rotation, scapular movement) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
