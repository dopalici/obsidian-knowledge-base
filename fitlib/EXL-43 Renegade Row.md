### **EXL-43: Renegade Row**

**ID:** EXL-43-DB-RENEGADEROW **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A challenging compound exercise performed in a plank position with hands on dumbbells, involving rowing one dumbbell towards the chest while stabilizing the torso with the other arm and core. Develops back strength, core anti-rotational stability, and shoulder stability.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires significant core strength and shoulder stability).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at top).
- Add Push-up between rows [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Perform on knees instead of toes.
- Widen foot stance for more stability.
- Perform standard Plank [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]] and Dumbbell Rows [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]] separately first.
- Bird Dog exercise [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Rowing Arm:** Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius, Biceps Brachii, Posterior Deltoid.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis - _high_ anti-rotational demand) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Glutes, Quadriceps, Serratus Anterior, Pectoralis Major, Triceps (supporting arm), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place two dumbbells (hex dumbbells recommended for stability) shoulder-width apart on floor. Assume a high plank (push-up) position with hands gripping dumbbell handles, feet hip-to-shoulder width apart (wider stance provides more stability). Body should form a straight line from head to heels. Brace core tightly.
- **Execution:** Shift weight slightly onto one supporting arm. Keeping hips square to the floor (minimize rotation), pull the other dumbbell towards chest/rib cage, retracting scapula and leading with elbow. Pause briefly. Lower dumbbell back to floor under control. Repeat on the other side, alternating arms. Focus on maintaining rigid torso stability throughout.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during the row (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric) or breathe shallowly between reps while maintaining core brace.
- **Common Faults:** Excessive hip rotation/shifting, sagging hips, piking hips too high, incomplete row ROM, using momentum.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Wrist pain/injury (pressure on handles), shoulder instability, acute low back pain. Requires significant core strength to perform safely.
- **Safety:** Use dumbbells that provide a stable base (hexagonal). Master plank and standard dumbbell rows first. Start with light weight. Prioritize core stability and minimal hip rotation over lifting heavy.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets with strict form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip stability, core control, row ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
