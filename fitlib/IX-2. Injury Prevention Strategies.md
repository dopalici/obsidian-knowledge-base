### IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies
**ID:** IX-2-INJURY-PREVENTION
**Created:** 2025-04-24

While not all injuries are preventable, implementing evidence-based strategies can significantly reduce the risk of sustaining musculoskeletal injuries related to exercise and sport.

**Key Strategies:**
1.  **Appropriate Training Load Management:** Most crucial. Avoid sudden spikes in volume/intensity/frequency. Use gradual progressive overload ([[B1. Progressive Overload]]). Monitor load/recovery ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]). Consider ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio) cautiously ([Gabbett, 2016]).
2.  **Strength Training:** Strengthens tissues, increases resilience. Specific programs (Nordic Curls, FIFA 11+) reduce specific injury rates. Addresses imbalances. ([[B. Resistance Training]]). ([Lauersen et al., 2014]).
3.  **Proper Technique & Biomechanics:** Master correct form to minimize undue stress ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]).
4.  **Adequate Warm-up:** Prepare tissues with dynamic activity/stretching (related to [[F2. Performance Optimization Factors]]).
5.  **Mobility & Flexibility:** Maintain sufficient ROM, address limitations ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
6.  **Balance & Proprioception Training:** Enhance neuromuscular control/stability ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]).
7.  **Adequate Recovery:** Prioritize sleep ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]), nutrition (esp. [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]], [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]]), rest days/deloads (related to [[A26. Principle of Recovery]]). Avoid chronic fatigue/overreaching ([[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]]).
8.  **Appropriate Equipment:** Proper footwear/equipment fit and maintenance ([[VIII-5. Apparel & Footwear]]).
9.  **Address Muscle Imbalances:** Identify/correct significant strength/flexibility asymmetries.
10. **Listen to Your Body:** Modify/stop activity with persistent pain; seek assessment.
