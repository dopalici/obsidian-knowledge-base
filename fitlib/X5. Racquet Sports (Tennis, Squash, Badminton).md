Racquet sports like tennis, squash, and badminton are characterized by intermittent high-intensity bursts of activity involving rapid changes of direction, lunging, jumping, and powerful rotational movements (strokes), interspersed with short recovery periods.

\*\*Key Physical Demands:\*\*  
\- \*\*Agility & Change of Direction (COD):\*\* Crucial for court coverage, reacting to opponent's shots. Requires rapid deceleration, multi-directional movement, acceleration.  
\- \*\*Power:\*\* Explosive power needed for serves, smashes, groundstrokes. Involves rotational power from core/hips, upper body striking power, lower body power for jumping/pushing off. (\[\[B13-STRENGTH-TRAINING-GOALS\]\]).  
\- \*\*Speed & Reaction Time:\*\* Short court sprints, quick reactions to fast-moving ball/shuttlecock.  
\- \*\*Muscular Endurance:\*\* Ability to sustain repeated high-intensity actions (strokes, lunges) throughout a match. Particularly important in shoulder, forearm, legs, core.  
\- \*\*Cardiovascular Fitness:\*\* Aerobic base needed for recovery between points/games and sustaining effort over match duration. Anaerobic capacity needed for high-intensity rallies (\[\[E1-AEROBIC-ANAEROBIC\]\]).  
\- \*\*Mobility & Flexibility:\*\* Good range of motion needed in shoulders (serving, strokes), hips (lunging, rotation), thoracic spine (rotation) (\[\[L2-MOBILITY-FLEXIBILITY\]\]).  
\- \*\*Hand-Eye Coordination:\*\* Essential for tracking ball/shuttlecock and timing strokes.

\*\*Training Components:\*\*  
\- \*\*Conditioning:\*\* Interval training mimicking work:rest ratios of the sport (e.g., short high-intensity bursts with short recovery). Agility drills (cone drills, ladder drills, reactive COD drills). Court-specific movement drills. Aerobic base work.  
\- \*\*Strength & Power Training:\*\*  
    \- \*Strength:\* Foundational strength via compound lifts (squats, lunges, presses, rows). Unilateral exercises important (single-leg strength, single-arm rows/presses). Grip strength crucial.  
    \- \*Power:\* Medicine ball throws (rotational, overhead), plyometrics (jumps, bounds), potentially Olympic lift variations, kettlebell swings/snatches (\[\[B9-KETTLEBELL-TRAINING\]\]). Focus on rotational power development (\[\[L1-MOVEMENT-PATTERNS\]\]).  
    \- \*Shoulder Care:\* Specific exercises targeting rotator cuff strength/endurance and scapular stability to prevent injury.  
\- \*\*Mobility & Flexibility:\*\* Dynamic warm-ups. Specific mobility work for shoulders, hips, T-spine. Static stretching post-activity.  
\- \*\*Technical Skill Practice:\*\* On-court practice of strokes, serves, footwork, strategy.

\*\*Nutrition & Hydration:\*\* Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake for fuel during matches/training. Hydration and electrolyte balance critical, especially during long matches or hot conditions (\[\[C4-HYDRATION\]\], \[\[C5-ELECTROLYTES\]\]).

\*\*Common Injuries (\[\[IX-1-COMMON-MSK-INJURIES\]\]):\*\* Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis), rotator cuff tendinopathy/impingement, wrist injuries, ankle sprains, knee injuries (patellar tendinopathy, meniscus), lower back pain. Often overuse injuries related to high volume of repetitive strokes or inadequate conditioning/biomechanics.
