**ID:** C12-PALEO-DIET **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

The Paleolithic (Paleo) diet aims to emulate the eating patterns of humans during the Paleolithic era (before agriculture), focusing on whole, unprocessed foods thought to be available to hunter-gatherers.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Foods Typically Included:** Lean meats, fish, seafood, fruits, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs.
- **Foods Typically Excluded:** Cereal grains (wheat, rice, corn, oats), legumes (beans, lentils, peas, peanuts), dairy products, refined sugars, potatoes (though sometimes included), salt (added), refined vegetable oils, processed foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].
- **Emphasis:** Whole, unprocessed foods; often higher in protein and lower-to-moderate in carbohydrates compared to standard diets, with fat intake varying based on choices.

**Proposed Benefits & Rationale:**

- Based on the premise that human genetics are best adapted to pre-agricultural foods.
- Potential benefits attributed to high intake of whole foods and exclusion of processed items: improved weight management, glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors (short-term evidence exists, long-term less clear) [].

**Nutrient Considerations & Criticisms:**

- **Restrictiveness:** Excludes major food groups (dairy, grains, legumes) known to provide valuable nutrients and have associated health benefits [[C10. Mediterranean Diet]], [[C11. Vegetarian & Vegan Diets]].
- **Calcium & Vitamin D:** Exclusion of dairy requires careful attention to non-dairy sources (leafy greens, bony fish, potentially fortified foods if allowed by interpretation, supplements) [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
- **Carbohydrates for Athletes:** Can be challenging to consume sufficient carbohydrates for high-intensity or endurance exercise performance without including denser sources like potatoes or large amounts of fruit [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]], [[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]].
- **Fiber:** Intake can be high from fruits/vegetables, but lacks the diversity provided by whole grains and legumes [[A3. Macronutrients]].
- **Sustainability:** Adherence can be difficult long-term due to restrictions.
- **Historical Accuracy Debated:** Actual Paleolithic diets varied significantly based on geography and time; modern farmed produce differs from wild ancestors.

**Fitness Considerations:**

- Can support fitness if energy requirements are met and carbohydrate intake is adequate for training demands.
- Protein intake is typically sufficient or high [[C16. High-Protein Diets]].
- Focus on whole foods aligns with general healthy eating principles [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].
