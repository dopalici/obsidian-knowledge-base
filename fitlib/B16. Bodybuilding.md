### B16. Bodybuilding
**ID:** B16-BODYBUILDING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Bodybuilding is a discipline focused primarily on developing muscular size (hypertrophy), symmetry, and definition (low body fat) for aesthetic competition or personal goals.

**Training Principles:**
- **Hypertrophy Focus:** Primary goal is maximizing muscle growth ([[B3. Hypertrophy Training Principles]]). Training emphasizes mechanical tension, metabolic stress, potentially muscle damage.
- **High Volume:** Generally utilizes higher training volumes (sets/reps) compared to strength-focused training ([[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]]).
- **Moderate Intensity/Reps:** Typically uses moderate loads (60-85% 1RM) for moderate repetition ranges (6-15+ reps), often training close to failure.
- **Isolation Exercises:** Significant use of isolation exercises alongside compound movements to target specific muscle groups.
- **Training Splits:** Commonly employs split routines (body part splits, push/pull/legs, upper/lower) to allow sufficient volume/recovery per muscle group.
- **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Emphasis on feeling the target muscle working.
- **Variety:** Often incorporates various exercises, angles, techniques.
- **Peaking Phase:** Specific strategies (diet, water/electrolyte manipulation) for maximal definition pre-competition.

**Nutritional Considerations:** Phases of "bulking" (caloric surplus - [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]]) and "cutting" (caloric deficit - [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]]) are common. Very high protein intake often utilized ([[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]).

**Posing:** Essential component of competition, requires practice.
