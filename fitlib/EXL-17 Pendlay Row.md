### **EXL-17: Pendlay Row**

**ID:** EXL-17-BB-PENDLAYROW **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A strict variation of the barbell bent-over row where the barbell starts and returns to a dead stop on the floor for each repetition. This minimizes momentum and targets the upper back muscles explosively from a static start.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires excellent hip hinge, spinal stability, and explosive power).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]] (Typically performed for lower reps due to explosive nature).
- Focus on accelerating the bar maximally.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Standard Barbell Bent-Over Row [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]] (allows slight momentum/stretch reflex).
- Chest-Supported Rows [[EXL-28 Dumbbell Bench Supported Row (Chest Supported)]] / [[EXL-58 Chest Supported Row (Machine)]] (isolates back, less technical).
- Dumbbell Rows [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]].
- Improve explosive pulling strength and hip hinge [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (Middle & Lower), Rhomboids, Teres Major.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Erector Spinae (strong isometric hold).
- **Stabilizers:** Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus (isometric hold), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Forearm flexors (grip). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-to-shoulder width apart, mid-foot under bar. Hinge deeply at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]], keeping knees slightly bent, until torso is parallel or very near parallel to floor. Maintain strict neutral spine. Grip bar with overhand grip wider than shoulders. Arms straight.
- **Execution:** Brace core tightly. Explosively pull the barbell off the floor directly towards the lower chest/upper abdomen, leading with elbows. Focus on maximum acceleration. Squeeze back muscles at the top. Lower the bar back to the floor under control, returning to a dead stop before initiating the next rep. Torso angle should remain relatively constant throughout the pull (minimal "heave").
- **Breathing:** Often involves bracing before the pull, potentially exhaling explosively during the pull or resetting breath between reps.
- **Common Faults:** Lifting torso significantly during the pull, rounding the lower back, using excessive arm pull instead of back contraction, bouncing bar off floor.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Low back injuries, poor hip hinge mechanics, limited hamstring flexibility [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]]. Requires excellent spinal control.
- **Safety:** Master standard bent-over rows and hip hinge first. Prioritize maintaining torso angle and neutral spine. Use appropriate weight â€“ focus is on explosive pull, not maximal load compared to standard rows.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets with explosive form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Bar velocity (if available).
- Qualitative assessment of technique (strict torso angle, explosive pull, spinal neutrality).
