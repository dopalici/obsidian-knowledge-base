### **EXL-62: Calf Raise (Machine - Seated)**

**ID:** EXL-62-MEX-CALFRAISE-SEATED **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] targeting the calf muscles, specifically the soleus, through ankle plantarflexion while the knees are bent (seated).

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack or Plates) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at top/bottom, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Leg Seated Calf Raise.
- Progress to Standing Calf Raises [[EXL-61 Calf Raise (Machine - Standing)]] / [[EXL-20 Barbell Calf Raise]] / [[EXL-42 Dumbbell Calf Raise (Standing)]] (to emphasize gastrocnemius).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Reduce range of motion initially.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Soleus (emphasized due to knee being bent).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Gastrocnemius (less active than in standing raise), Tibialis Posterior, Peroneus Longus/Brevis, Flexor Hallucis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Longus.
- **Stabilizers:** Muscles controlling foot/ankle stability.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on machine, place balls of feet firmly on platform edge, heels hanging off. Position knees under lever pad securely. Release safety lever if applicable.
- **Execution:** Lower heels towards floor slowly, achieving a full stretch in the soleus/Achilles tendon. Pause briefly. Push forcefully through the balls of the feet to raise heels as high as possible (plantarflexion), contracting the calf muscles. Squeeze at the top. Control the descent slowly back to the stretched position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during heel raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Bouncing at the bottom, using momentum, incomplete range of motion (insufficient stretch or peak contraction), lifting knees off pad.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute ankle issues, Achilles tendinopathy (requires careful loading).
- **Safety:** Ensure proper setup. Control the weight throughout full ROM. Avoid bouncing.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, full ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
