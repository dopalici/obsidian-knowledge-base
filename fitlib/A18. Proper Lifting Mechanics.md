\*\*Created:\*\* 2025-04-23

Proper lifting mechanics involve using biomechanically efficient and safe postures and movement patterns during resistance training to maximize force production towards the goal, minimize stress on vulnerable tissues (especially spine, joints), and reduce injury risk.

\*\*Key Principles:\*\*  
\- \*\*Maintain Spinal Neutrality:\*\* Avoid excessive flexion, extension, or rotation of the lumbar/thoracic spine under load. Engage core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]]) to create intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and trunk stiffness (Valsalva maneuver often used appropriately in heavy lifting).  
\- \*\*Hip Hinge Proficiency:\*\* Ability to flex/extend primarily at the hips while maintaining neutral spine (crucial for deadlifts, swings, good mornings \- [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]).  
\- \*\*Appropriate Joint Alignment:\*\* Tracking knees over toes (avoiding excessive valgus/varus), maintaining stable shoulder position (scapular retraction/depression as needed).  
\- \*\*Control Through Full ROM:\*\* Smooth, controlled movements, especially during eccentric phase. Avoid momentum unless intended (e.g., Olympic lifts).  
\- \*\*Stable Base of Support:\*\* Feet positioned appropriately for balance and force transfer ([[A14. Biomechanics Center of Gravity (COG)  Center of Mass (COM)]]).  
\- \*\*Breathing Pattern:\*\* Coordinate breathing with movement (e.g., inhale during eccentric, exhale during concentric or use Valsalva for maximal lifts).

\*\*Application to Fundamental Lifts:\*\*  
\- \*\*Squat:\*\* Neutral spine, hip/knee flexion tracking toes, depth based on mobility, stable foot pressure.  
\- \*\*Hinge (Deadlift):\*\* Neutral spine, hip hinge initiation, bar close to body, shoulders over bar initially.  
\- \*\*Push (Bench/Overhead Press):\*\* Stable shoulder/scapular position, appropriate bar path, neutral spine/wrist.  
\- \*\*Pull (Row/Pull-up):\*\* Scapular retraction/depression initiation, neutral spine, pulling through elbows.  
\- \*\*Carry:\*\* Maintain upright posture, neutral spine, core braced.

\*\*Implications:\*\* Mastering proper mechanics is foundational for safe and effective resistance training progression. Requires instruction, practice, and potentially addressing mobility/stability limitations ([[A17. Movement Screening]]).
