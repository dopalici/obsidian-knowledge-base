### **EXL-68: Cable Overhead Triceps Extension (Rope/Bar)**

**ID:** EXL-68-CEX-OHTRIEXT **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the triceps, specifically emphasizing the long head due to the overhead position. The cable provides constant tension throughout the range of motion.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at full extension, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Cable Overhead Extension.
- Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension [[EXL-35 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)]].
- Barbell Skullcrusher / Overhead Extension [[EXL-13 Barbell Skullcrusher (Lying Triceps Extension)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Cable Triceps Pushdown [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]].
- Resistance Band Overhead Triceps Extension [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Machine Triceps Extension [[EXL-59 Triceps Extension (Machine - Overhead or Pushdown type)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (long head highly emphasized).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (especially standing), Scapular stabilizers, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach a rope or bar handle to a low pulley cable. Stand facing away from the machine (or seated facing away/towards). Grasp handle(s) and bring them overhead with elbows bent, upper arms close to head. Maintain stable stance (feet shoulder-width, knees slightly bent if standing) or seated position, core engaged.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary and close to head (avoid excessive elbow flare), exhale and extend elbows fully, pressing the handle(s) upwards/forwards. Focus on contracting the triceps. Pause briefly at full extension. Inhale and slowly lower the handle(s) back behind head by bending elbows, feeling a stretch in triceps.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during extension (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Flaring elbows excessively, moving upper arms forward/backward, arching lower back (if standing), incomplete range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or shoulder injuries (impingement). Requires adequate shoulder flexion mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- **Safety:** Control the weight throughout the movement. Keep upper arms stable. Use appropriate weight. Standing version requires more core stability.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, elbow position, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
