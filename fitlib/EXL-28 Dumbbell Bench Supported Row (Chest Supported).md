### **EXL-28: Dumbbell Bench Supported Row (Chest Supported)**

**ID:** EXL-28-DB-ROW-CHESTSUP **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A dumbbell row variation performed lying prone on an incline bench. The chest support minimizes momentum and isolates the upper back muscles more effectively than unsupported rows.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Bench Incline Angle (higher incline may target upper back slightly differently).
- Progress to unsupported rows like Single Arm Dumbbell Row [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]] or Barbell Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]] / [[EXL-18 Yates Row (Underhand Barbell Row)]] to increase core stability demand.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Seated Cable Row [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]].
- Machine Row (Chest Supported) [[EXL-58 Chest Supported Row (Machine)]].
- Resistance Band Rows [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (Middle), Rhomboids, Teres Major.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae (less demand than unsupported rows), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set an incline bench to approximately 30-45 degrees. Lie prone (face down) on the bench with chest supported, feet planted firmly on floor or bench supports. Grasp dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other), arms hanging straight down.
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by retracting scapulae. Pull dumbbells up towards torso/armpits, leading with elbows. Keep elbows relatively close to body. Squeeze back muscles at the top. Avoid lifting chest off the bench significantly or using excessive momentum. Lower dumbbells under control back to starting position, allowing scapulae to protract at the bottom.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum, lifting chest off pad, shrugging shoulders, pulling dumbbells too high (towards shoulders), incomplete range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries. May be better tolerated than unsupported rows for individuals with lower back issues due to reduced spinal loading.
- **Safety:** Ensure bench is stable. Control the weight throughout the movement. Use appropriate load allowing strict form.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (chest position, scapular movement, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
