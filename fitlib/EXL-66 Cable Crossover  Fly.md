### **EXL-66: Cable Crossover / Fly**

**ID:** EXL-66-CEX-CROSSOVER **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a cable station [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the pectoralis major muscles. Involves bringing the arms together (adduction) against the constant tension provided by the cables. Cable height can be varied to emphasize different parts of the chest.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Squeeze at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Cable Height (High-to-low = lower chest focus; Low-to-high = upper chest focus; Mid-height = mid-chest focus).
- Single-Arm Cable Fly (increases core stability demand [[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- Dumbbell Flyes [[B8. Free Weights (Barbells, Dumbbells)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Machine Pec Deck Fly [[EXL-54 Pec Deck Fly (Machine)]]
- Resistance Band Chest Flyes [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major (sternal and clavicular heads, emphasis depends on cable angle).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Coracobrachialis, Biceps Brachii (short head).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers (Rhomboids, Middle Traps), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set pulleys to desired height (e.g., slightly above shoulder height for standard crossover). Grasp D-handles attached to pulleys. Stand in center, step forward slightly into a stable stance (staggered or square), core engaged. Arms extended out to sides with slight bend in elbows, feeling a stretch across chest.
- **Execution:** Exhale and bring handles together in front of body in a wide, controlled arc (horizontal adduction). Maintain slight elbow bend throughout. Focus on squeezing pectoral muscles together. Handles may meet or cross slightly at the center. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly reverse the motion under control, allowing arms to return to starting stretched position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during adduction (concentric), inhale during return/abduction (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Bending elbows excessively (turning it into a press), using momentum/leaning too far forward, incomplete range of motion, shoulders rolling forward, shrugging.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff, AC joint), history of shoulder dislocations. Ensure proper setup and avoid overstretching.
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight allowing strict form and control. Maintain stable stance. Avoid letting weight stack slam. Control the eccentric phase.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (smooth arc, minimal elbow bend change, controlled eccentric) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
