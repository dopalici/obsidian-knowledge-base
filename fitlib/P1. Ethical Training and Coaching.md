### P1. Ethical Training and Coaching
**ID:** P1-ETHICAL-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-25

Ethical practice in fitness training and coaching involves adhering to professional standards and moral principles to ensure client safety, well-being, and autonomy, while providing competent and evidence-based guidance.

**Core Ethical Principles (Adapted from various professional codes):**
1.  **Non-Maleficence (Do No Harm):** Prioritize client safety by designing appropriate programs, ensuring proper technique instruction ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]), managing training load effectively ([[O1. Integrated Programming Considerations]]), recognizing contraindications ([[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications]]), and avoiding excessive or unsafe practices.
2.  **Beneficence (Do Good):** Act in the best interests of the client, aiming to help them achieve their fitness and health goals effectively and safely.
3.  **Autonomy:** Respect the client's right to make informed decisions about their own body, goals, and participation in training. Provide clear information about risks/benefits (informed consent). Respect preferences and values.
4.  **Competence:** Provide services only within the scope of one's knowledge, skills, and professional qualifications. Maintain and update professional competence through continuing education. Refer clients to other qualified professionals (physicians, dietitians, physical therapists, mental health professionals) when issues are outside scope of practice (e.g., diagnosing injuries, prescribing specific diets for medical conditions, treating mental health disorders).
5.  **Confidentiality/Privacy:** Protect client's personal and health information according to privacy laws and professional standards.
6.  **Integrity/Honesty:** Be truthful in qualifications, services offered, potential outcomes, and advertising. Avoid misleading claims or guarantees ([[J3. Misinformation in Fitness]]). Disclose potential conflicts of interest (e.g., supplement sales).
7.  **Professionalism:** Maintain professional boundaries, treat clients with respect, avoid exploitation, adhere to codes of conduct from certifying bodies (e.g., ACSM, NSCA, ACE).
8.  **Justice/Fairness:** Treat all clients equitably, regardless of background, ability, or other characteristics.

**Common Ethical Issues in Fitness:**
- **Practicing Outside Scope:** Providing specific nutritional prescriptions for medical conditions (role of RD), diagnosing injuries (role of medical professional), providing psychological therapy.
- **Misleading Marketing/Guarantees:** Promising unrealistic results or timeframes. Using manipulated images.
- **Inappropriate Exercise Prescription:** Prescribing exercises unsafe or unsuitable for client's level/limitations. Pushing clients beyond safe limits without regard for recovery or risk.
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Aggressively promoting supplement sales or specific products for personal gain without clear evidence or client need.
- **Breaches of Confidentiality:** Sharing client information inappropriately.
- **Lack of Informed Consent:** Not fully explaining risks/benefits of program or specific exercises.
- **Ignoring Client Needs/Goals:** Imposing own training philosophy without considering client autonomy or preferences.
- **Failure to Refer:** Not referring client to appropriate healthcare provider when necessary.

**Best Practices:** Adhere to code of ethics from certifying organizations, prioritize client safety and well-being, engage in evidence-based practice ([[J2. Evaluating Scientific Research in Fitness]]), maintain clear communication, respect boundaries, pursue ongoing education.
