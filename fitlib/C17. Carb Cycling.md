Carb cycling is a dietary strategy involving planned, periodic variations in carbohydrate intake – alternating between higher-carb and lower-carb days or periods. The rationale is to align carbohydrate intake with energy demands (e.g., training intensity/volume) or manipulate metabolic processes to optimize body composition or performance.

**Proposed Mechanisms & Benefits (Largely Theoretical):**

- **Fueling Performance:** Matching higher carbohydrate intake to high-intensity/volume training days ensures adequate glycogen stores and fuel availability [[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]], [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]].
- **Enhancing Fat Loss/Preventing Adaptation:** Utilizing lower carbohydrate intake on rest or low-intensity days may promote fat oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity. Periodic high-carb days ("refeeds") within a deficit might temporarily boost leptin levels and mitigate some metabolic adaptation [[C8. Metabolic Adaptation (Adaptive Thermogenesis)]], though effects are likely modest and short-lived.
- **Improving Body Composition:** Aims to support muscle gain/retention via insulin's effects on high-carb days while promoting fat loss on low-carb days.
- **Metabolic Flexibility:** Theoretically trains the body to efficiently switch between carbohydrate and fat metabolism.
- **Psychological/Adherence:** Planned higher-carb days can improve dietary adherence and satisfaction compared to continuous restriction [[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]].

**Common Implementation Strategies:**

- **Training Day vs. Rest Day:** Higher carbs on training days, lower carbs on rest days.
- **Intensity-Based:** Highest carbs on high-intensity/volume days, moderate carbs on moderate days, lowest carbs on rest/low-intensity days.
- **Refeed Schedule:** Incorporating 1-2 high-carb days per week or periodically within a prolonged fat loss phase.
- **Adjustments:** Protein intake often remains relatively constant daily, while fat intake is typically adjusted inversely with carbohydrates to meet daily calorie targets [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]].

**Evidence Base:**

- There is **limited direct scientific evidence** specifically comparing carb cycling protocols to isocaloric, macronutrient-matched non-cycling diets for long-term body composition or performance outcomes.
- The purported benefits are largely extrapolated from research on nutrient timing [[C3. Nutrient Timing]], metabolic adaptation [[C8. Metabolic Adaptation (Adaptive Thermogenesis)]], and the physiological effects of carbohydrate manipulation.
- Effectiveness likely stems from its potential to improve adherence to an overall appropriate energy balance and macronutrient plan, rather than unique metabolic advantages of the cycling itself [].

**Considerations:**

- Requires significant planning, tracking, and attention to detail.
- May be overly complex for beginners.
- Effectiveness depends heavily on setting appropriate macro/calorie targets for the different day types and ensuring overall weekly balance aligns with goals.
