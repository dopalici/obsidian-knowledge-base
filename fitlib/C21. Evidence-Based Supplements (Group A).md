**ID:** C21-EVIDENCE-BASED-SUPPLEMENTS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

This category includes supplements with strong scientific backing for efficacy and relative safety in specific sport/exercise contexts, as recognized by major sports nutrition bodies like the ISSN and IOC [].

- **Creatine Monohydrate:**
    - **Mechanism:** Increases intramuscular phosphocreatine (PCr) stores, enhancing ATP regeneration during short, high-intensity bursts [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]. Also acts as an osmolyte, drawing water into muscle cells.
    - **Effects:** Robust evidence shows improved performance in high-intensity, intermittent exercise (strength, power, sprint performance); increases training capacity leading to greater long-term gains in lean mass and strength [].
    - **Dosage:** Loading phase (optional): ~20g/day (e.g., 4 x 5g) for 5-7 days. Maintenance: 3-5g/day.
    - **Safety:** Extensively studied and considered safe for healthy individuals at recommended doses [].
- **Caffeine:**
    - **Mechanism:** Central nervous system stimulant (adenosine receptor antagonist); reduces perception of effort (RPE); increases alertness; may enhance calcium release in muscle.
    - **Effects:** Proven ergogenic aid for endurance performance, high-intensity exercise (including team sports), and potentially strength/power (effect size more variable) [].
    - **Dosage:** Effective dose typically 3-6 mg/kg body weight consumed ~60 minutes pre-exercise. Higher doses increase side effect risk (anxiety, insomnia, GI upset) without further performance benefit. Genetics influence response.
- **Beta-Alanine:**
    - **Mechanism:** Precursor to muscle carnosine synthesis. Carnosine acts as an intracellular buffer against hydrogen ion (H+) accumulation during intense exercise.
    - **Effects:** Improves performance in sustained high-intensity exercise lasting ~1-10 minutes by delaying fatigue. Benefits activities limited by acidosis.
    - **Dosage:** Requires chronic loading: 4-6 g/day (typically split into doses of ≤2g to manage paresthesia - tingling) for at least 4 weeks [].
- **Sodium Bicarbonate:**
    - **Mechanism:** Extracellular buffer; increases blood bicarbonate levels, enhancing H+ removal from muscle during intense exercise.
    - **Effects:** Improves performance in short-duration (~1-10 min), high-intensity activities limited by acidosis (e.g., sprints, middle-distance events, repeated high-intensity bouts).
    - **Dosage:** 0.2-0.4 g/kg body weight consumed 60-180 minutes pre-exercise. High potential for GI distress (bloating, nausea, diarrhea); requires careful individual testing, often using split doses or enteric-coated forms.
- **Nitrate (from Diet or Supplements, e.g., Beetroot Juice):**
    - **Mechanism:** Converted to Nitric Oxide (NO), which improves blood flow, mitochondrial efficiency (reduces oxygen cost of exercise), and muscle contractility.
    - **Effects:** Improves endurance performance (particularly in events ~4-30 minutes), intermittent high-intensity exercise tolerance. Effects potentially more pronounced in less-trained individuals.
    - **Dosage:** ~5-9 mmol nitrate (300-600 mg) consumed 2-3 hours pre-exercise. Chronic loading (3-7 days) may also be effective. Beetroot juice is a common source.
- **Protein Supplements (Whey, Casein, etc.):**
    - **Mechanism:** Convenient source to help meet daily protein targets [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]. Not inherently superior to high-quality whole food protein.
    - **Effects:** Supports muscle repair, recovery, and hypertrophy when overall daily protein intake is adequate. Can aid in achieving optimal protein distribution [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
    - **Dosage:** As needed to supplement diet, typically 20-40g per serving.
- **Carbohydrate Supplements (Sports Drinks, Gels, Powders):**
    - **Mechanism:** Provide exogenous carbohydrate fuel during exercise.
    - **Effects:** Maintain blood glucose and spare muscle glycogen during prolonged (>60-90 min) or intense exercise, improving endurance performance [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]].
    - **Dosage:** 30-90 g/hour depending on duration/intensity and tolerance [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
- **Correction of Deficiencies:** Supplements like **Iron** and **Vitamin D** fall into this category when used appropriately under guidance to correct diagnosed deficiencies that could impair performance or health [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
