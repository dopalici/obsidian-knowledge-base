Movement screening involves using standardized tests to assess fundamental movement patterns, identifying limitations, asymmetries, and potential injury risk factors before implementing a training program.

\*\*Purpose:\*\*  
\- Identify significant movement dysfunction (pain, major limitations, asymmetries).  
\- Establish baseline movement competency.  
\- Guide corrective exercise strategies and program design.  
\- Potentially identify individuals at higher risk for injury (though predictive validity debated).

\*\*Common Screening Tools/Concepts:\*\*  
\- \*\*Functional Movement Screen (FMS™):\*\* Standardized screen with 7 fundamental movement tests scored on quality (0-3 scale). Includes Deep Squat, Hurdle Step, In-line Lunge, Shoulder Mobility, Active Straight Leg Raise, Trunk Stability Push-up, Rotary Stability. (Cook G, et al., Movement).  
\- \*\*Overhead Squat Assessment (e.g., NASM):\*\* Assesses dynamic flexibility, core strength, balance, neuromuscular control. Identifies compensations (e.g., feet turn out, excessive forward lean, arms fall forward, knee valgus).  
\- \*\*Other Screens:\*\* Y-Balance Test (dynamic balance), Landing Error Scoring System (LESS \- jump landing mechanics).

\*\*Interpretation & Application:\*\*  
\- Screens identify \*movement quality\*, not performance capacity.  
\- Pain during screening requires referral for clinical evaluation.  
\- Results guide selection of corrective exercises targeting mobility, stability, or motor control limitations.  
\- Helps determine appropriate starting points for exercise progression.  
\- Limitations: Predictive power for injury is moderate at best and context-dependent; screens don't replace thorough clinical assessment (Bardenett et al., 2017).
