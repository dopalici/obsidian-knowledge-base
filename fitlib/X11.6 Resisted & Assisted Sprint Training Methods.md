Resisted and assisted sprint training methods are specialized techniques used to overload specific phases of the sprint or target specific neuromuscular qualities (force vs. velocity). They should be used strategically alongside regular sprint training.

**Resisted Sprint Training:** Involves sprinting against external resistance to overload propulsive forces, primarily targeting the acceleration phase.
- **Methods:**
    - *Sled Towing:* Pulling a weighted sled via harness. Load crucial: ~10-20% bodyweight often recommended to improve acceleration mechanics without significantly altering technique; heavier loads (>30%+) shift stimulus towards strength development.
    - *Hill Sprints:* Running uphill forces greater horizontal force production and specific muscle recruitment patterns similar to acceleration. Gradient influences effect.
    - *Resistance Bands/Parachutes:* Provide variable resistance. Parachutes primarily effective at higher speeds.
- **Goals:** Improve acceleration mechanics, increase horizontal force production capacity, enhance specific strength of propulsive muscles.
- **Considerations:** Load must be carefully selected to avoid excessive changes in sprint kinematics (posture, ground contact time, stride parameters). Focus remains on maximal intent and technique. Full recovery needed.

**Assisted Sprint Training (Overspeed Training):** Involves sprinting with external assistance to achieve velocities slightly higher than unassisted maximum speed.
- **Methods:**
    - *Downhill Running:* Sprinting on slight decline (typically 1-3% grade). Gravity assists acceleration.
    - *Towing Systems:* Using elastic cords or motorized devices to provide slight pulling force.
- **Goals:** Target neuromuscular system to adapt to faster limb velocities and potentially improve stride frequency (turnover). Improve maximum velocity phase potential.
- **Considerations:** Requires careful control to avoid altering mechanics negatively ("over-reaching," increased braking forces). Assistance should only allow speed increase of ~5-10% above maximum. Higher injury risk if not implemented correctly (esp. hamstring strains due to rapid eccentric loading). Use sparingly and with experienced athletes/coaching.

**Programming:** These methods are supplementary tools, not replacements for regular sprinting and strength/power training. Typically incorporated 1-2 times per week during specific training blocks, focusing on either acceleration (resisted) or max velocity (assisted).
