### B4. Strength Training Principles
**ID:** B4-STRENGTH
**Created:** 2025-04-23 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Strength training prioritizes increasing the maximal force-generating capacity of the neuromuscular system. Gains are driven by both neural adaptations (improved motor unit recruitment, firing rate, coordination) and structural changes (muscle hypertrophy, connective tissue strengthening). Programming differs from pure hypertrophy focus by emphasizing higher intensity and neural factors.

**Key Stimulating Mechanisms:**
- **High Mechanical Tension & Force Production:** Lifting heavy loads (>80-85% 1RM) maximally recruits high-threshold motor units and requires high levels of force generation per fiber.
- **Neural Adaptations:** Crucial for strength expression, especially early in training or with heavy loads. Includes:
    - *Increased Motor Unit Recruitment:* Activating more motor units simultaneously.
    - *Increased Rate Coding:* Faster firing frequency of activated motor units.
    - *Improved Motor Unit Synchronization:* More coordinated firing of motor units.
    - *Reduced Antagonist Co-activation:* Less opposing force from antagonist muscles.
    - *Improved Intermuscular Coordination:* Better coordination between different muscle groups involved in a lift. ([Folland & Williams, 2007]).

**Optimal Training Parameters for Maximal Strength:**
- **Intensity:** High intensity is paramount. Primarily training with loads **â‰¥85% of 1RM**, corresponding to repetition ranges of **1-5 reps** per set. Occasional lower intensity work can aid recovery/volume accumulation, but heavy loading drives maximal strength adaptation.
- **Volume ([[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]]):** Moderate volume. Typically **2-6 working sets per exercise**. Total weekly volume often lower than hypertrophy programs due to high intensity and neural fatigue. Focus on quality execution of heavy sets.
- **Frequency ([[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]]):** Training specific movement patterns or lifts **2-4 times per week** allows sufficient practice and stimulus while managing recovery. Higher frequencies require careful load/volume management per session.
- **Rest Periods ([[B6. Rest and Recovery for Optimal Adaptation (Resistance Training Focus)]]):** **Longer rest periods (3-5+ minutes)** are essential between heavy sets to allow near-complete ATP-PCr resynthesis and neural recovery, enabling maintenance of high force output and technique quality across sets.
- **Exercise Selection:** Emphasis on **multi-joint, compound exercises** (squats, deadlifts, presses, rows) that allow for heavy loading and mimic functional strength patterns. Assistance exercises target specific weaknesses supporting main lifts.
- **Specificity ([[A20. Principle of Specificity (SAID)]]):** Train movements and contraction types specific to the desired strength outcome (e.g., powerlifting focuses on competition lifts). Velocity specificity implies heavy, slow lifting optimizes low-velocity strength.

**Considerations:** Requires mastery of technique ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]) before heavy loading. High neural demand necessitates careful fatigue management and recovery ([[M. Recovery Strategies]]). Often periodized ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]) with phases emphasizing different qualities (e.g., hypertrophy base before strength block).
