### **EXL-07: Barbell Hip Thrust**

**ID:** EXL-07-BB-HIPTHRUST **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A compound exercise performed with the upper back supported on a bench, involving lifting a barbell placed across the hips by driving through the heels and extending the hips. Primarily targets the gluteus maximus.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires proper setup and execution to maximize glute activation and avoid hyperextension).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause and squeeze at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Banded Hip Thrusts (add band around knees for abduction focus).
- Single-Leg Hip Thrust [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Feet-Elevated Hip Thrust.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Glute Bridge [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Dumbbell Hip Thrust [[B8. Free Weights (Barbells, Dumbbells)]].
- Frog Pumps.
- Cable Pull-Through [[EXL-79 Cable Pull-Through]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings, Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Quadriceps (isometric), Erector Spinae. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on floor with upper back against the side of a stable bench (shoulder blades near the edge). Roll a padded barbell over legs until it rests in the hip crease. Place feet flat on floor, hip-width apart, knees bent. Adjust foot position so shins are approximately vertical at the top of the movement.
- **Execution:** Brace core. Drive through heels, lifting hips towards the ceiling until torso and thighs form a straight line (full hip extension). Focus on squeezing glutes hard at the top. Keep chin tucked slightly, gaze forward (avoid looking up) to maintain neutral neck/spine alignment. Lower hips back towards floor under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during hip extension (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Arching lower back excessively at the top (lumbar hyperextension instead of hip extension), insufficient range of motion (not reaching full hip extension), pushing through toes instead of heels, pushing bench away, excessive neck extension.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or hip injuries. Ensure proper setup to avoid discomfort from the bar [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Use a pad on the barbell for comfort. Ensure bench is stable and won't slide. Control the movement. Focus on driving through hips, not arching the back.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (full hip extension, neutral spine, glute squeeze at top).
