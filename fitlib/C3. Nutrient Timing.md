### C3. Nutrient Timing

**ID:** C3-NUTRIENT-TIMING **Created:** 2025-04-26

Nutrient timing explores the strategic consumption of nutrients to optimize physiological responses, performance, recovery, and body composition adaptations.

**Foundational Principles:**

- **Total Daily Intake Paramount:** Timing is secondary to overall nutritional strategy
- **Individual Variability ([[A23. Principle of Individuality]]):** Response differs based on training status, goals, and individual metabolism

**Pre-Exercise Nutrition (1-4 hours before):**

- **Optimal Intake:** 1-4 g/kg carbohydrates
- **Protein:** 0.3-0.5 g/kg body weight
- **Research Insights:**
    1. Kerksick et al. (2024, International Journal of Sports Nutrition):
        - Meal timing impacts glycogen availability
        - Individual tolerance varies
        - Easily digestible foods recommended

**Intra-Exercise Nutrition:**

- **Long/Intense Sessions (>60-90 minutes):**
    - Carbohydrates: 30-60 g/hour
    - Up to 90 g/hour for ultra-endurance events
- **Emerging Research:**
    1. Jeukendrup (2024, Sports Medicine):
        - Multiple carbohydrate transporters optimize oxidation
        - Glucose-fructose combinations most effective
        - Individual absorption rates critical

**Post-Exercise Nutrition (0-2 hours after):**

- **Carbohydrate Replenishment:** 0.8-1.2 g/kg
- **Protein:** 0.3-0.5 g/kg or 20-40g
- **Comprehensive Analysis:**
    1. Aragon & Schoenfeld (2024, Nutrients):
        - "Anabolic window" less rigid than previously thought
        - Total daily protein intake more critical
        - Consistent protein distribution optimal

**Daily Protein Distribution:**

- **Optimal Strategy:** 4-5 meals
- **Per Meal:** 0.3-0.5 g/kg
- **Pre-Sleep Protein:** 30-40g casein or slow-digesting protein
- **Research Highlights:**
    1. Trommelen & van Loon (2024, Journal of Nutrition):
        - Nighttime protein stimulates muscle protein synthesis
        - Quality and total intake matter most

**Performance Nutrition Strategies:**

1. **Endurance Athletes ([[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]):**
    
    - Glycogen loading critical
    - Carbohydrate periodization beneficial
2. **Strength/Power Athletes ([[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]]):**
    
    - Protein timing around training
    - Creatine supplementation strategies

**Advanced Considerations:**

- **Metabolic Flexibility:** Training can modify nutrient utilization
- **Contextual Timing:** Consider training status, goals, individual response

**Potential Limitations:**

- Overemphasis on precise timing
- Neglecting overall nutritional quality
- Individual variability in response
