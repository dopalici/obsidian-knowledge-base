**ID:** C18-FLEXIBLE-DIETING **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Flexible dieting, popularly known as "If It Fits Your Macros" (IIFYM), is a quantitative approach to nutrition that prioritizes meeting specific daily targets for macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat) and often total calories and fiber, rather than restricting specific food types.

**Core Principles:**

- **Macronutrient & Calorie Tracking:** Requires accurately monitoring food intake (using food scales, measuring tools, tracking apps) to hit predetermined daily targets [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]], [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]].
- **Food Neutrality (in Isolation):** No foods are inherently "good" or "bad." Any food can theoretically be incorporated into the diet, provided it fits within the day's macro/calorie budget.
- **Focus on Quantity:** Emphasis is on achieving quantitative targets for energy and macronutrients.
- **Flexibility & Inclusivity:** Allows for the inclusion of preferred foods, treats, and social eating occasions, which can significantly enhance long-term adherence [[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]].

**Implementation:**

1. Determine appropriate daily calorie and macronutrient targets based on individual goals (e.g., fat loss [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]], muscle gain [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]], performance). Often includes a fiber target as well.
2. Track food intake meticulously using reliable tools (food database apps like MyFitnessPal, Cronometer; food scale).
3. Adjust food choices throughout the day to meet the set targets.

**Potential Benefits:**

- **Improved Adherence:** Increased dietary flexibility often leads to better long-term sustainability compared to rigid, restrictive diets [].
- **Reduced Food Anxiety/Guilt:** Can foster a healthier relationship with food by removing moralistic labels and reducing feelings of deprivation [[P3. Body Image and Fitness Culture]].
- **Nutritional Education:** Enhances understanding of the energy and macronutrient content of various foods.
- **Effectiveness for Body Composition:** Highly effective for altering body composition when targets are set correctly and consistently met [[H2. Realistic Muscle Gain Rates]], [[H3. Realistic Fat Loss Rates]].

**Potential Drawbacks & Best Practices:**

- **Risk of Poor Food Quality:** If solely focused on hitting numbers, individuals might neglect micronutrient intake [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]] and overall diet quality by choosing primarily processed foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].
    - **Best Practice:** Aim to meet macro targets predominantly (**~80-90%**) with whole, nutrient-dense foods, allowing the remainder for more discretionary choices. Ensure fiber targets are also met.
- **Tracking Burden:** Requires consistent and accurate tracking, which can be time-consuming, tedious, or potentially triggering for individuals prone to obsessive behaviors.
- **Accuracy Issues:** Relies on accurate food databases and precise measurement.
