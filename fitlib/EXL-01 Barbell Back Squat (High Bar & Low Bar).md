### **EXL-01: Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)**

**ID:** EXL-01-BB-SQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-28

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental compound exercise involving squatting down and standing back up with a barbell positioned across the upper back (either high on the traps or lower across the rear deltoids). Develops lower body strength, hypertrophy, core stability, and is a cornerstone of many strength programs.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires good mobility, stability, and technique, especially under load).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused Squats, Slow Eccentrics [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Add Accommodating Resistance (Bands [[B11. Resistance Bands]], Chains).
- Front Squat [[EXL-08 Barbell Front Squat]].
- Zercher Squat [[EXL-19 Zercher Squat]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Goblet Squat [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]].
- Bodyweight Squat [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Leg Press [[EXL-46 Leg Press (Machine)]].
- Hack Squat [[EXL-50 Hack Squat (Machine)]].
- Box Squats (to control depth and build confidence).
- Improve Hip/Ankle Mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Hamstrings (especially in low bar), Soleus.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Core Musculature (Abdominals, Obliques) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Gluteus Medius/Minimus, Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids - supporting bar). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (High Bar):** Bar rests high on trapezius shelf. Grip slightly wider than shoulders. Stance typically shoulder-width, toes slightly out. Torso remains relatively upright.
- **Setup (Low Bar):** Bar rests lower, across rear deltoids/spine of scapula. Requires more shoulder mobility. Grip may be wider. Stance often slightly wider. Involves greater forward torso lean/hip hinge component.
- **Execution (General):** Unrack bar, take stable stance. Brace core deeply (Valsalva). Initiate descent by breaking simultaneously at hips and knees ("sit back and down"). Maintain neutral spine throughout â€“ avoid excessive rounding (butt wink) or arching. Keep chest up. Track knees in line with toes (avoid valgus collapse). Descend until hip crease is below top of knee (or to depth allowed by mobility/bar position). Drive up powerfully through mid-foot, leading with chest/upper back, extending hips and knees synchronously.
- **Breathing:** Deep inhale and brace before descent, hold or forcefully exhale during ascent through sticking point.
- **Common Faults:** Lumbar flexion ("butt wink"), excessive forward lean (esp. high bar), knee valgus, insufficient depth, chest falling forward, uneven rising (hips faster than shoulders), bar rolling on back.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injury (disc issues), significant knee pain/injury (meniscus, severe arthritis), hip impingement/arthritis. Requires careful assessment and modification based on individual mechanics and limitations [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Use a power rack or squat stand with safety bars set correctly. Master technique before adding significant load. Ensure adequate hip/ankle/thoracic mobility. Learn how to fail safely. Spotters recommended for maximal attempts.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max (e.g., 3RM, 5RM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed at a specific load or RPE.
- Bar velocity (Velocity Based Training).
- Qualitative assessment of technique (depth, spinal position, knee tracking).
