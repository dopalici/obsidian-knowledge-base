### **EXL-21: Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)**

**ID:** EXL-21-DB-BENCH **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An upper-body compound exercise performed lying supine on a bench, pressing two dumbbells upwards from chest level. Develops pushing strength and hypertrophy, similar to the barbell bench press but requiring greater stabilization.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires more coordination and stabilization than barbell or machine versions).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Incline Dumbbell Bench Press [[EXL-22 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press]].
- Decline Dumbbell Press.
- Alternating Dumbbell Press (increases core stability demand [[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- Single-Arm Dumbbell Press (further increases stability demand).
- Barbell Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]] (allows heavier load).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Machine Chest Press [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Floor Press (Dumbbell [[EXL-44 Dumbbell Floor Press]] or Barbell [[EXL-12 Barbell Floor Press]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major (sternal and clavicular heads), Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Coracobrachialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Biceps Brachii (co-contraction), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], muscles controlling scapular stability. Significantly greater stabilizer demand than barbell version.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on bench end with dumbbells resting on thighs. Kick dumbbells up to shoulder level one at a time as you lie back. Feet flat on floor, maintain 5 points of contact (head, upper back, glutes, both feet). Retract and depress scapulae. Dumbbells held at chest level, palms typically facing forward or slightly inward (neutral grip), elbows slightly tucked.
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower dumbbells under control towards the sides of the chest, allowing a slightly deeper stretch than possible with a barbell. Keep elbows tucked at a comfortable angle (~45-75 degrees). Exhale and press dumbbells back up towards the starting position, converging slightly towards the midline at the top. Focus on squeezing chest muscles. Avoid letting dumbbells drift too wide or touch at the top (maintains tension).
- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Excessive elbow flare, unstable shoulders (lack of scapular retraction), uncontrolled descent, insufficient range of motion, pressing dumbbells too far forward (over shoulders) instead of over chest, uneven pressing.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff tear), unstable shoulder joint, elbow tendinopathy. May be better tolerated than barbell press for some shoulder issues due to freer movement path, but instability can also be problematic.
- **Safety:** Master getting dumbbells into position safely (kicking up). Control the weight, especially during lowering. Don't go excessively heavy without being able to control the dumbbells. Ensure bench is stable.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of stability and control throughout the movement [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
