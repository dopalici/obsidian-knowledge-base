**ID:** C33-ANTI-INFLAMMATORY-DIETS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

While acute inflammation is a necessary physiological process (e.g., for healing, training adaptation), chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of many non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain cancers. Anti-inflammatory diets emphasize foods and dietary patterns thought to modulate inflammatory pathways and reduce markers of chronic inflammation (e.g., hs-CRP, IL-6) [].

**Characteristics of Anti-Inflammatory Dietary Patterns:** These diets typically share common features:

- **High Intake:**
    - **Fruits & Vegetables:** Abundant in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and diverse phytonutrients (polyphenols, carotenoids) with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Berries, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables are often highlighted.
    - **Fatty Fish:** Rich source of marine omega-3 fatty acids (EPA & DHA), which have well-documented anti-inflammatory effects [[A3. Macronutrients]].
    - **Nuts & Seeds:** Provide unsaturated fats, fiber, magnesium, Vitamin E, and polyphenols. Walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds are good sources of plant-based omega-3 (ALA).
    - **Whole Grains:** Rich in fiber, which supports gut health [[C32. Gut Health and Microbiome]] and production of anti-inflammatory SCFAs.
    - **Legumes:** Provide fiber, protein, and phytonutrients.
    - **Healthy Fats:** Particularly monounsaturated fats from extra virgin olive oil (rich in oleocanthal) and avocados.
    - **Herbs & Spices:** Many contain potent anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g., curcumin in turmeric, gingerol in ginger, allicin in garlic).
- **Low Intake / Avoidance:**
    - **Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs):** Often high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, unhealthy fats (trans fats, excessive omega-6 relative to omega-3), sodium, and additives, all of which can promote inflammation [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].
    - **Refined Sugars & Grains:** Can contribute to inflammation, particularly when consumed in excess.
    - **Processed & Red Meats:** High intake linked to increased inflammatory markers.
    - **Trans Fats:** Strongly pro-inflammatory.
    - **Excessive Omega-6 Fats:** From certain refined vegetable oils (corn, soybean) relative to omega-3 intake.

**Examples of Anti-Inflammatory Dietary Patterns:**

- **Mediterranean Diet:** Extensive evidence links adherence to reduced inflammation and cardiovascular risk [[C10. Mediterranean Diet]], [].
- **DASH Diet:** Focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, lean protein, and sodium restriction; shown to lower blood pressure and inflammatory markers [].
- **Well-Planned Plant-Based Diets:** Emphasize whole plant foods naturally rich in anti-inflammatory components [[C11. Vegetarian & Vegan Diets]].

**Fitness & Recovery:**

- While intense exercise acutely increases inflammation (a necessary signal for adaptation), chronic inflammation can hinder recovery and performance.
- Adopting an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern supports overall health, potentially enhances recovery processes, and may mitigate excessive exercise-induced inflammation over the long term []. See [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]].
- Note: High-dose antioxidant supplements [[C34. Antioxidants]] are distinct from an anti-inflammatory diet and may blunt training adaptations.
