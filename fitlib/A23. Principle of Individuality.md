### A23. Principle of Individuality
**ID:** A23-PRINCIPLE-INDIVIDUALITY

*(Content based on FZC-1.5)*
The Principle of Individuality recognizes that individuals respond uniquely to the same training program due to genetics, age, sex, training history, nutrition, sleep, stress, etc. This necessitates personalized program design and ongoing adjustments based on individual response.

**Factors:** Genetics ([[K1. Genetic Factors in Athletic Performance]]), Age ([[N1. Fitness Across the Lifespan]]), Sex ([[I2. Female-Specific Physiological Considerations]]), Training History, Nutrition ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]), Sleep ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]), Stress ([[M3. Stress Management and Performance]]), Health Status ([[G3. Training with Health Limitations  Chronic Conditions]]).

**Implications:** No one-size-fits-all approach. Monitoring ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]) and program individualization are crucial for optimizing results and managing "non-responders".
