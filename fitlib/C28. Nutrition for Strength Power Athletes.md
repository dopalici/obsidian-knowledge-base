Nutrition strategies for strength and power athletes (e.g., powerlifters, weightlifters, sprinters, throwers, field athletes) aim to optimize high-intensity training performance, maximize adaptations in strength, power, and hypertrophy, facilitate recovery, and achieve/maintain an optimal body composition for performance [[B. Resistance Training]], [[X11. Sprinting]].

**Key Nutritional Strategies:**

1. **Adequate Energy Intake:** Must meet the demands of intense training and support recovery/adaptation [[A1. Energy Balance]]. Caloric needs depend heavily on training volume/intensity, body size, and body composition goals (maintenance, muscle gain [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]], or fat loss [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]]). Maintaining adequate Energy Availability is critical to prevent negative hormonal and performance consequences [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]].
2. **Sufficient Protein Intake:** Paramount for repairing muscle damage and synthesizing new muscle tissue. General recommendation is **1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight per day** [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]. Distributing intake relatively evenly across the day (4-5 meals, 0.3-0.5 g/kg per meal) optimizes MPS [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
3. **Adequate Carbohydrate Intake:** Primary fuel for anaerobic glycolysis, the dominant energy system [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]] during high-intensity strength/power training bouts. Adequate intake ensures sufficient muscle glycogen stores to fuel performance and maintain training quality. Intake typically ranges from **3-6+ g/kg/day** depending on training volume and overall caloric needs [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]].
4. **Nutrient Timing:**
    - **Peri-Workout:** Consuming carbohydrates and protein around training sessions can support performance and recovery [[C3. Nutrient Timing]]. Pre-workout intake (~1-4h prior) ensures fuel availability. Post-workout intake (within ~2h) aids recovery and MPS.
    - **Daily Distribution:** Consistent protein intake throughout the day is crucial (see point 2).
5. **Hydration:** Dehydration can impair strength, power, and cognitive function. Maintain euhydration throughout the day and replace fluids lost during training [[C4. Hydration]].
6. **Key Supplements:**
    - **Creatine Monohydrate:** Highly effective and well-supported for increasing maximal strength, power output, and training capacity (3-5g/day) [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].
    - **Caffeine:** Can enhance alertness, focus, power output, and reduce perceived exertion (3-6mg/kg pre-training) [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].
    - **Beta-Alanine:** May benefit performance in repeated high-intensity efforts or sets lasting ~1-4 minutes [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].
    - **Protein Supplements:** Convenient tool to help meet daily protein requirements [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].
7. **Body Composition Management:** Athletes may cycle caloric intake to optimize strength/power while managing body weight or achieving specific weight classes. This requires careful manipulation of energy balance and macronutrients [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]].
