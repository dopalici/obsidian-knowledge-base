### X11.1 Sprint Start & Acceleration Technique
**ID:** X11.1-START-ACCEL
**Created:** 2025-04-26

The sprint start (from blocks or standing/rolling start) and subsequent acceleration phase (~0-30m) are critical for achieving high maximal velocity. The primary goal is to overcome inertia and generate maximal horizontal velocity as quickly as possible by optimizing horizontal ground reaction force (GRF) production.

**Biomechanical Goals:**
- Maximize net horizontal impulse (Force x Time).
- Minimize braking forces.
- Achieve effective projection angle.
- Rapidly increase stride frequency and length.

**Technical Elements (Block Start Example):**
- **Set Position:** Optimal hip height, shin angles, shoulder position over hands to create pre-tension and advantageous projection angle. Stable base. Focused attention.
- **Initial Push-Off:** Powerful, simultaneous extension of both legs ("triple extension" of hip, knee, ankle) against blocks, driving body forward horizontally. Front leg drives knee forward aggressively.
- **First Steps:** Low heel recovery, foot striking ground behind center of mass (COG), powerful backward push-off emphasizing horizontal force vector. Maintain significant forward body lean, gradually becoming more upright over ~10-20m.
- **Arm Action:** Forceful, coordinated swing (elbows ~90 degrees) driving opposite arm forward with rising knee, contributing to force production and balance.
- **Stride Development:** Initially shorter, more frequent strides focusing on pushing backward. Gradually transition to longer strides with higher knee lift as velocity increases and posture becomes more upright.

**Common Faults:**
- Standing up too quickly (insufficient forward lean, reduces horizontal force application).
- Casting the foot out in front of COG (causes braking forces).
- Insufficient leg drive/extension.
- Poor arm action (crossing midline, insufficient force).
- Inconsistent step length/rhythm.

**Training Methods:**
- **Block Practice:** Refining set position, reaction time, initial push-off mechanics.
- **Short Sprints (10-40m):** From various starts (blocks, 3-point, standing) focusing on maximal effort acceleration. Full recovery needed.
- **Resisted Sprints:** Sled towing (~10-20% bodyweight for optimal mechanics, heavier for strength focus), hill sprints, resistance bands. Overloads horizontal force production muscles/mechanics. Must not significantly distort technique.
- **Wall Drills / Piston Drills:** Isolate leg drive mechanics and posture.
- **Strength Training:** Focus on concentric strength/power in hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings), knee extensors (quads), ankle plantarflexors ([[X11.4 Strength Training Programming for Sprinters]]).
