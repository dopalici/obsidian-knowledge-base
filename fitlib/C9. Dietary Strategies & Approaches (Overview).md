Numerous named dietary strategies and eating patterns exist, often defined by specific food inclusions/exclusions or macronutrient distributions. Examples include Mediterranean, Vegan, Paleo, Keto, Intermittent Fasting, Low-Carb, High-Protein, Flexible Dieting, and Intuitive Eating (detailed in subsequent notes C10-C19).

**Evaluating Dietary Strategies:** While various approaches can be effective for achieving specific goals (e.g., weight loss, health improvement, performance enhancement), their success hinges on fundamental principles rather than the specific "brand name" of the diet []. Key factors determining effectiveness include:

1. **Energy Balance:** Does the strategy successfully manipulate energy balance [[A1. Energy Balance]] according to the goal (e.g., create a deficit for fat loss [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]], provide a surplus for muscle gain [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]])?
2. **Macronutrient Adequacy & Distribution:** Does it provide sufficient protein [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]] to support goals, adequate carbohydrates [[A3. Macronutrients]] for performance needs, and essential fats? Is the distribution [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]] appropriate for the individual's context?
3. **Micronutrient Sufficiency:** Does it provide adequate vitamins and minerals [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]] to prevent deficiencies? Highly restrictive diets may require careful planning or supplementation.
4. **Adherence & Sustainability:** Is the diet practical, enjoyable, and sustainable for the individual long-term, considering lifestyle, preferences, culture, and budget? Adherence is the primary predictor of long-term success, particularly for weight management [[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]].
5. **Food Quality:** Does it emphasize nutrient-dense, whole, or minimally processed foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]]?
6. **Health Impact:** What are the evidence-based short-term and long-term effects on relevant health markers (e.g., blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure, inflammation)?

**Key Takeaway:** No single named diet is universally superior for all individuals or goals. Effectiveness is primarily determined by achieving appropriate energy balance and macronutrient targets sustainably, while ensuring micronutrient adequacy and supporting overall health. Individual response and preference are crucial [[A23. Principle of Individuality]].
