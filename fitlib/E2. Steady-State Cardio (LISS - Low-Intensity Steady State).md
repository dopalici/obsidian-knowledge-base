### E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)
**ID:** E2-LISS
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Low-Intensity Steady State (LISS) cardio involves performing aerobic exercise at a constant, low-to-moderate intensity for a sustained duration, typically 30-60 minutes or longer.

**Characteristics:**
- **Intensity:** Low-to-moderate, typically ~50-70% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) or within Zone 1-2 HR zones ([[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]]). Intensity allows for conversation ("talk test"). Below the first lactate threshold (LT1 - related to [[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]).
- **Duration:** Sustained, typically >30 minutes.
- **Mode:** Any continuous aerobic activity (e.g., walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, elliptical).
- **Energy System:** Primarily relies on the oxidative (aerobic) system (related to [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]), utilizing fats as a significant fuel source.

**Benefits:**
- **Builds Aerobic Base:** Improves fundamental cardiovascular adaptations like mitochondrial density, capillary density, stroke volume, and fat oxidation efficiency (related to [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]]).
- **Improved Recovery:** Can be used as active recovery, potentially enhancing blood flow without significant additional stress ([[M1. Recovery Modalities Evidence and Application]]).
- **Lower Impact/Stress:** Generally lower musculoskeletal stress and perceived exertion compared to higher intensity methods. Suitable for beginners or during recovery periods.
- **Fat Oxidation:** Effective at improving the body's ability to utilize fat for fuel at lower intensities.
- **Sustainability:** Easier to maintain consistency due to lower perceived effort.

**Limitations:** Less time-efficient for improving VO2max compared to HIIT ([[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]]). May not provide sufficient stimulus for significant anaerobic adaptations.

**Programming:** Forms the foundation ('base') of many endurance training programs (see Polarized Training - related to [[X1. Running (Track, Road, Trail)]]). Useful for general health, recovery, and building foundational endurance capacity.
