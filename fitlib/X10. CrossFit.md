CrossFit is a branded fitness regimen characterized by constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movements. Workouts (WODs \- Workout of the Day) typically combine elements of Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, gymnastics/calisthenics, running, rowing, and other modalities.

\*\*Core Tenets & Methodology:\*\*  
\- \*\*Constantly Varied:\*\* Workouts change daily, aiming to develop broad, general fitness across multiple domains rather than specialization.  
\- \*\*High Intensity:\*\* Emphasis on performing workouts at high relative intensity, often measured by time to completion or total reps within a time limit.  
\- \*\*Functional Movements:\*\* Utilizes multi-joint movements mimicking natural patterns (squats, deadlifts, presses, pulls, Olympic lifts, basic gymnastics \- [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]

\*\*Key Physical Demands:\*\* Requires broad capacity across multiple fitness domains:  
\- \*\*Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance:\*\* Needed for longer "metcon" (metabolic conditioning) workouts.  
\- \*\*Stamina (Muscular Endurance):\*\* Ability to sustain repeated movements.  
\- \*\*Strength:\*\* Foundational for lifting components.  
\- \*\*Power:\*\* Required for Olympic lifts, jumping, explosive movements.  
\- \*\*Speed:\*\* Developed through sprinting, cycling, rowing intervals.  
\- \*\*Flexibility & Mobility:\*\* Needed for safe execution of lifts (e.g., overhead squat, snatch) and gymnastics movements.  
\- \*\*Coordination, Agility, Balance, Accuracy:\*\* Developed through varied movements and skill practice.

\*\*Training Components:\*\*  
\- \*\*WODs:\*\* Daily workouts often combining multiple modalities (e.g., AMRAP \- As Many Reps/Rounds As Possible; For Time; EMOM \- Every Minute On the Minute).  
\- \*\*Strength Work:\*\* Dedicated sessions or components within WODs focusing on powerlifting/weightlifting movements.  
\- \*\*Gymnastics Skill Practice:\*\* Developing proficiency in bodyweight movements (pull-ups, handstands, muscle-ups, etc.).  
\- \*\*Metabolic Conditioning:\*\* Workouts designed to challenge cardiovascular and energy systems endurance.

\*\*Benefits:\*\* Can lead to significant improvements in broad, general fitness across multiple domains. Strong community aspect provides motivation and support. Develops proficiency in a wide range of movements.

\*\*Criticisms & Considerations:\*\*  
\- \*\*Injury Risk:\*\* Potential for higher injury rates compared to traditional programs if coaching quality is poor, programming lacks appropriate scaling/progression, or participants push beyond technical capacity due to high-intensity/competitive environment. Common injuries involve shoulders, back, knees. (\[Hak et al., 2013; Weisenthal et al., 2014\]). Quality of coaching varies significantly between affiliates.  
\- \*\*Programming Randomness vs. Structure:\*\* "Constantly varied" approach may hinder optimal progress towards specific goals compared to structured periodization, although programming quality varies. Potential for conflicting stimuli within single sessions ([[E4. Interval Training (General)]]..  
\- \*\*Technical Proficiency:\*\* High-skill movements (Olympic lifts, gymnastics) require significant time and quality coaching to master safely, which may not always be adequately provided or prioritized in group class setting focused on intensity.

\*\*Implementation:\*\* Choose affiliate with qualified coaches emphasizing technique and scaling options. Prioritize movement quality over intensity/speed, especially when learning. Listen to body and manage recovery appropriately.
