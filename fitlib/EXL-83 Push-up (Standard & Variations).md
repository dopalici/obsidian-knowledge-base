### **EXL-83: Push-up (Standard & Variations)**

**ID:** EXL-83-BW-PUSHUP **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental bodyweight exercise [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] involving lowering and raising the body using the arms while maintaining a straight torso. Primarily targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Includes numerous variations to adjust difficulty.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (depending on variation). Standard push-up is typically Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pauses).
- Decline Push-ups (Feet elevated).
- Close-Grip / Diamond Push-ups (more triceps emphasis).
- Wide-Grip Push-ups (more chest emphasis).
- Plyometric Push-ups (explosive).
- Weighted Push-ups (Weight plate on back, weighted vest).
- One-Arm Push-up progressions.
- Ring Push-ups [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]] (instability).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Incline Push-ups (Hands elevated on bench/wall).
- Knee Push-ups.
- Focus on Plank variations [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]]
- Machine Chest Press [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Dumbbell Bench Press [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Coracobrachialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Glutes, Quadriceps, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on floor (standard push-up). Extend legs back, supporting weight on hands and toes. Body forms a straight line from head to heels. Engage core and glutes to prevent hips sagging or piking.
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower chest towards floor by bending elbows. Keep elbows tucked at a comfortable angle (typically ~45-60 degrees relative to torso, not flared out excessively). Lower until chest is close to floor or upper arms are parallel to floor. Maintain straight body line. Exhale and press forcefully through hands, extending elbows to return to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent (eccentric), exhale during ascent (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Hips sagging or piking, flaring elbows too wide, forward head posture, incomplete range of motion, shoulders shrugging.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Wrist pain can sometimes be alleviated with push-up handles or performing on fists (knuckles down).
- **Safety:** Maintain core stability to protect lower back. Progress difficulty gradually. Ensure proper hand placement and elbow tracking.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed for specific sets.
- Qualitative assessment of form (body line, depth, elbow position) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Progression through variations.
