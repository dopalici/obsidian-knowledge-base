### X11.3 Speed Endurance Development
**ID:** X11.3-SPEED-ENDURANCE
**Created:** 2025-04-26

Speed endurance refers to the ability to maintain maximal or near-maximal sprint velocity for as long as possible, or the ability to resist fatigue and minimize deceleration during sprints longer than ~60-80 meters (e.g., 150m, 200m, 400m, repeated sprints in team sports). It involves both metabolic (energy supply, buffering capacity) and neuromuscular (maintaining neural drive/coordination under fatigue) components.

**Physiological Basis:**
- **Metabolic Factors:** Primarily stresses the glycolytic system ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]), leading to high lactate and H+ accumulation (acidosis), which impairs muscle contraction and enzyme function. Training improves buffering capacity (ability to neutralize H+) and potentially lactate clearance/tolerance. Oxidative system capacity influences recovery between repeated sprints (RSA).
- **Neuromuscular Factors:** Fatigue leads to decreased motor unit recruitment, firing rate, and impaired coordination, resulting in technique breakdown and reduced force/power output. Maintaining neural drive under fatigue is crucial.

**Types of Speed Endurance:**
- **Short Speed Endurance (Alactic Speed Endurance):** Ability to repeat short, maximal sprints (<10s) with minimal drop-off, relying heavily on rapid ATP-PCr resynthesis (influenced by aerobic fitness). Relevant for team sports (RSA).
- **Glycolytic Speed Endurance (Lactic Speed Endurance):** Ability to maintain high speed during efforts lasting ~15-60+ seconds (e.g., 200m, 400m), limited by metabolic byproduct accumulation and neuromuscular fatigue.

**Training Methods:**
1.  **Short Speed Endurance / RSA Training:** Repeated short sprints (e.g., 6-10 x 20-40m) with incomplete recovery (e.g., 20-60 seconds rest). Aims to challenge ATP-PCr resynthesis and maintain performance across repetitions.
2.  **Intensive Tempo / Special Endurance 1 (Glycolytic Production/Tolerance):** Longer sprints (e.g., 150m-300m) performed at high intensity (90-95%+) with relatively long recovery periods (e.g., 5-10+ minutes). Focuses on sustaining near-maximal speed and tolerating metabolic byproducts.
3.  **Lactate Tolerance / Special Endurance 2 (Glycolytic Buffering):** Repeated longer sprints (e.g., 3-6 x 200m-400m) with incomplete recovery (e.g., 2-5 minutes). Generates very high lactate levels, training the body's buffering capacity and ability to perform under severe metabolic stress. Highly demanding.
4.  **Extensive Tempo:** Longer intervals (e.g., 200m-600m) performed at lower intensity (~70-85%) with shorter recovery periods. Primarily targets aerobic system contribution to recovery and specific endurance, less stressful than intensive tempo.

**Programming Considerations:**
- Speed endurance sessions are highly fatiguing and require significant recovery. Typically performed 1-2 times per week during specific training phases.
- Intensity and recovery periods must be carefully prescribed to target the desired physiological system/quality.
- Maintaining technique under fatigue is a key focus during these sessions.
