### E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
**ID:** E3-HIIT
**Created:** 2025-04-23

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) involves repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods (either passive rest or low-intensity active recovery).

**Characteristics:**
- **Intensity (Work Intervals):** High intensity, typically ≥85-95% HRmax, ≥90% VO2max, or RPE >7-8. Intensity should feel "hard" to "very hard".
- **Duration (Work Intervals):** Highly variable, from short bursts (~10-30 seconds, sometimes called Sprint Interval Training - SIT) up to several minutes (~2-5 minutes).
- **Intensity (Recovery Intervals):** Low intensity (active recovery) or complete rest (passive recovery).
- **Duration (Recovery Intervals):** Variable, ratio of work:rest depends on goal and specific protocol (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:1).
- **Total Session Duration:** Typically shorter than LISS (10-30 minutes of actual work), but overall session time includes warm-up/cool-down.
- **Energy Systems:** Heavily stresses both anaerobic and aerobic systems ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]), depending on interval length/intensity.

**Benefits:**
- **Time Efficiency:** Can elicit similar or greater improvements in VO2max, mitochondrial biogenesis, and insulin sensitivity compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in less total exercise time (Gibala et al., 2012).
- **Improved VO2max:** Potent stimulus for improving maximal aerobic capacity ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]).
- **Enhanced Anaerobic Capacity:** Improves tolerance for high-intensity work and anaerobic energy system function.
- **Cardiometabolic Health:** Effective for improving insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, body composition.
- **Muscle Fiber Recruitment:** Recruits Type II muscle fibers more significantly than LISS.

**Risks/Considerations:** Higher perceived exertion, greater musculoskeletal stress, higher cardiovascular stress. Requires careful progression, adequate recovery, and may not be suitable for all populations without modification. Frequency typically limited to 2-3 sessions per week.

**Protocols:** Examples include Tabata (20s work / 10s rest x 8), Wingate (30s all-out sprint / several minutes rest), longer intervals (e.g., 4x4 min at ~90-95% HRmax / 3 min active recovery).
