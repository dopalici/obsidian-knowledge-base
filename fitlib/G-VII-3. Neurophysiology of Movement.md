Movement control involves complex interactions between the central nervous system (CNS - brain, spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (PNS - nerves connecting CNS to muscles/sensory receptors).

**Key Components & Processes:**
- **Motor Cortex:** Area in brain responsible for planning, initiating, and directing voluntary movements.
- **Cerebellum & Basal Ganglia:** Involved in coordinating movement, balance, posture, motor learning, smoothing out movements.
- **Spinal Cord:** Transmits motor commands from brain to muscles via motor neurons; contains reflex circuits.
- **Motor Unit:** A single alpha motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates ([[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]]). The fundamental unit of motor control. Motor unit recruitment (activating more units) and rate coding (increasing firing frequency) control muscle force production. Follows Henneman's Size Principle (smaller/Type I units recruited first).
- **Proprioceptors:** Sensory receptors providing information about body position, movement, and force. Crucial for feedback and motor control.
    - **Muscle Spindles:** Located within muscle fibers, detect changes in muscle length and rate of change (stretch). Mediate stretch reflex (myotatic reflex), contribute to muscle tone.
    - **Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs):** Located in tendons, detect changes in muscle tension. Mediate inverse stretch reflex (autogenic inhibition), protecting against excessive force. Play role in PNF stretching (related to [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
    - **Joint Receptors:** Located in joint capsules/ligaments, detect joint position, movement, pressure.
    - **Vestibular System (Inner Ear):** Detects head position and acceleration, crucial for balance.
- **Motor Learning & Skill Acquisition:** Process of improving motor skills through practice, involving neuroplasticity (changes in neural pathways and synapses). Stages: Cognitive (understanding task) -> Associative (refining movement) -> Autonomous (skill becomes automatic). Feedback (intrinsic/extrinsic) is critical.

**Implications for Training:**
- Strength gains initially driven by neural adaptations (improved recruitment, coordination - related to [[B4. Strength Training Principles]]).
- Proprioceptive training enhances balance and joint stability ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]).
- Technique practice refines motor programs for efficiency and skill.
- Understanding reflexes helps explain stretching responses and potential injury mechanisms.
