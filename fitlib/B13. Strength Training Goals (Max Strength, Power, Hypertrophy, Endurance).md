Resistance training can be programmed to prioritize different strength-related goals by manipulating training variables (related to [[O1. Integrated Programming Considerations]]).

- **Maximal Strength:** Goal is to lift the heaviest possible weight for 1 repetition (1RM). Requires high intensity (>85% 1RM), low reps (1-5), long rest periods (3-5+ min), focus on compound lifts, and emphasizes neural adaptations ([[B4. Strength Training Principles]]).
- **Power (Strength-Speed / Speed-Strength):** Goal is to move a load (light to heavy) at high velocity (Power = Force x Velocity). Requires moderate-to-high intensity (30-85% 1RM depending on goal), low reps (1-6), explosive concentric action, long rest periods. Includes plyometrics, Olympic lifts, ballistic movements. Emphasizes rate of force development (RFD) and neural efficiency.
- **Hypertrophy:** Goal is to increase muscle size. Requires moderate intensity (60-85% 1RM), moderate reps (6-15+), moderate rest periods (60-120s), sufficient volume (10-20+ sets/muscle/week), focus on mechanical tension and metabolic stress ([[B3. Hypertrophy Training Principles]]).
- **Muscular Endurance:** Goal is to resist fatigue during repeated contractions or sustained isometric holds. Requires lower intensity (<65-70% 1RM), high reps (15+), short rest periods (<60-90s). Emphasizes metabolic adaptations within muscle (buffering capacity, capillarization).

**Programming:** Periodization ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]) often involves phases focusing on different goals (e.g., hypertrophy block -> strength block -> power block). Concurrent training ([[E4. Concurrent Training (Interference Effect)]]) aims to develop multiple qualities simultaneously, requiring careful management.
