**Conceptual Overview:** Optimal nutrition underpins health, performance, and the body's ability to adapt to exercise. This note outlines the fundamental principles that form the basis of effective nutritional strategies, regardless of specific dietary approaches [[C9. Dietary Strategies & Approaches (Overview)]].

**Fundamental Pillars:**

1. **Energy Balance:** The primary determinant of body weight change. Matching energy intake (calories in) to energy expenditure (calories out) [[A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)]] is key [[A1. Energy Balance]]. Goals dictate target balance: deficit [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]], surplus [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]], or maintenance [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]]. See [[C7. Energy Balance & Nutritional Aspects of Weight Management]].
2. **Macronutrient Adequacy:** Consuming sufficient protein, carbohydrates, and fats to meet physiological needs and support goals [[A3. Macronutrients]], [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]].
    - Protein: For structure, enzymes, hormones, and crucial for muscle adaptation [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]].
    - Carbohydrates: Primary energy source for moderate-to-high intensity activity.
    - Fats: Essential for energy, cell membranes, hormone production.
3. **Micronutrient Sufficiency:** Obtaining adequate vitamins and minerals is essential for health and metabolic processes [[A4. Micronutrients]], [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]]. Deficiencies can impair function and performance.
4. **Hydration:** Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance is vital for numerous bodily functions, including performance and thermoregulation [[C4. Hydration]], [[C5. Electrolytes]].
5. **Food Quality:** Emphasizing whole, minimally processed foods provides higher nutrient density, fiber, and phytonutrients, supporting overall health, satiety, and gut health [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]], [[C32. Gut Health and Microbiome]].
6. **Sustainability & Adherence:** Dietary strategies must be practical and sustainable long-term for the individual to be effective [[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]], [[N3. Building Sustainable Fitness Habits]].

**Contextual Considerations:**

- **Nutrient Timing:** Can play a role in optimizing performance and recovery, especially for athletes [[C3. Nutrient Timing]], [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]].
- **Supplements:** Should be used strategically based on evidence to supplement, not replace, a healthy diet [[C20. Supplements (Overview & Framework)]] Supplements (Overview & Framework)], [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].

**Integration:** Nutritional strategies must align with training demands and recovery needs [[O3. Integrating Nutrition and Training]].
