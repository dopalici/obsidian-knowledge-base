### **EXL-70: Cable Hammer Curl (Rope)**

**ID:** EXL-70-CEX-HAMMERCURL **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An elbow flexion exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] and a rope attachment, performed with a neutral (palms facing) grip. This variation emphasizes the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles while providing constant tension.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Cable Hammer Curl (using D-handle).
- Progress to Dumbbell Hammer Curls [[EXL-31 Dumbbell Hammer Curl]].
- Cross-Body Cable Hammer Curl.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Hammer Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pulling movements (Rows, Pull-ups/Pulldowns).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Biceps Brachii.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Anterior Deltoid, Wrist Flexors/Extensors.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach rope handle to low pulley cable. Stand facing machine, grasp rope ends with neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keep feet stable, core engaged, elbows tucked close to torso. Start with arms fully extended.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary, exhale and curl rope ends upwards towards shoulders, maintaining neutral grip. Focus on contracting elbow flexors. Can keep hands together or slightly separate rope ends at top. Avoid leaning back or using momentum. Pause briefly. Inhale and slowly lower rope back to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using body swing, elbows moving forward, incomplete range of motion, losing neutral grip.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries.
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form. Keep upper arms stable. Control the weight against constant tension.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, neutral grip, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
