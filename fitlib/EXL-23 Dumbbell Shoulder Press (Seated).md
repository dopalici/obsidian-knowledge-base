### **EXL-23: Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)**

**ID:** EXL-23-DB-SHOULDERPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An upper-body compound exercise performed seated on a bench, involving pressing two dumbbells overhead. Primarily targets the deltoids and triceps. The seated position provides more stability than the standing version.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press (increases core stability demand [[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- Arnold Press [[EXL-45 Arnold Press]].
- Barbell Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Machine Shoulder Press [[EXL-52 Shoulder Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Resistance Band Shoulder Press [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Pike Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Focus on Lateral Raises [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]] and Front Raises [[EXL-25 Dumbbell Front Raise]] first.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid, Medial Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Upper Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Serratus Anterior, Trapezius (upper and middle).
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (less demand than standing but still active), Erector Spinae (maintaining posture).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on an upright bench (preferably with back support). Kick dumbbells up to shoulder height or clean them carefully. Hold dumbbells at shoulder level, palms typically facing forward or slightly inward. Maintain upright posture with back supported, feet flat on floor, core engaged.
- **Execution:** Exhale and press dumbbells vertically overhead until arms are fully extended but not locked out forcefully. Keep dumbbells slightly in front of the head, not directly over or behind. Control the descent (eccentric phase), inhaling as you lower the dumbbells back to the starting shoulder position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during press (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive arch in lower back (especially if no back support), pressing dumbbells forward instead of vertically, shrugging shoulders excessively, incomplete range of motion, letting dumbbells crash down.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). Ensure adequate shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]. Dumbbells allow for a more natural path which may be better tolerated than a barbell for some.
- **Safety:** Control the weight throughout the movement. Avoid using momentum. Ensure stable seated position. Be careful when getting heavy dumbbells into position.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, range of motion, posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
