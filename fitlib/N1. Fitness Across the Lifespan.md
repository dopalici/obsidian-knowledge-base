### N1. Fitness Across the Lifespan
**ID:** N1-LIFESPAN-FITNESS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Physical fitness development, maintenance, and decline are influenced by age-related physiological changes throughout the lifespan. Training goals and approaches should adapt accordingly to optimize health, function, and performance at different life stages. (Integrates concepts from [[G2. Age-Specific Exercise Recommendations]]).

**Childhood & Adolescence (Growth & Development Phase):**
- **Focus:** Motor skill acquisition, establishing broad movement competency, bone density development, fostering enjoyment of activity.
- **Physiology:** Rapid growth, hormonal changes (puberty), high neural plasticity.
- **Training:** Emphasize variety, play, skill-based activities. Introduce structured training gradually, focusing on technique over load. Resistance training beneficial for bone health and strength when properly supervised ([Lloyd et al., 2014]). Avoid early over-specialization.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Build a foundation of physical literacy and positive relationship with activity.

**Young Adulthood (Peak Potential Phase):**
- **Focus:** Reaching peak performance potential (strength, endurance, power), establishing robust health habits, managing career/life demands.
- **Physiology:** Generally peak physiological function (muscle mass, VO2max potential, recovery capacity).
- **Training:** Can tolerate higher volumes/intensities. Periodized programs targeting specific performance or body composition goals are effective. Establish consistent routines.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Maximize fitness potential, build habits for lifelong health.

**Middle Adulthood (Maintenance & Prevention Phase):**
- **Focus:** Maintaining fitness levels, preventing age-related decline (sarcopenia, bone loss, metabolic dysfunction), managing weight, reducing chronic disease risk.
- **Physiology:** Gradual decline in maximal HR, VO2max, muscle mass/strength begins (rate influenced by activity levels). Hormonal changes may affect body composition/recovery.
- **Training:** Resistance training becomes increasingly crucial to combat sarcopenia. Continued aerobic exercise vital for cardiovascular/metabolic health. Emphasis on consistency, injury prevention, recovery management. May need longer warm-ups, more attention to mobility.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Preserve function, mitigate age-related decline, maintain healthspan.

**Older Adulthood (Functional Capacity & Independence Phase):**
- **Focus:** Maintaining functional independence, preventing falls, managing chronic conditions, preserving muscle mass (sarcopenia) and bone density (osteoporosis), cognitive health, social engagement.
- **Physiology:** Accelerated decline in muscle mass/power (sarcopenia), bone density (osteoporosis risk), balance, potentially flexibility. Anabolic resistance (reduced muscle response to protein/exercise) may occur.
- **Training:** Multi-component programs essential: Strength (esp. power training - lifting lighter weights faster), Balance, Endurance, Flexibility. Higher protein intake recommended (~1.2-1.6+ g/kg) ([Bauer et al., 2013]). Modify exercises for safety/limitations (e.g., joint pain). Focus on functional exercises mimicking daily tasks. ([Fragala et al., 2019]).
- **Long-Term Goal:** Maximize healthspan, maintain independence, reduce disability.
