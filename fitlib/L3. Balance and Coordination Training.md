### L3. Balance and Coordination Training
**ID:** L3-BALANCE-COORDINATION
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Balance (ability to maintain equilibrium) and coordination (ability to perform smooth, accurate, controlled movements) are essential neuromuscular skills underpinning functional movement, athletic performance, and injury prevention (especially falls in older adults).

**Physiological Basis:** Relies on integration of sensory input (Vestibular, Visual, Proprioceptive systems) by the CNS ([[G-VII-3. Neurophysiology of Movement]]) and coordinated motor output to maintain center of gravity over base of support ([[A14. Biomechanics Center of Gravity (COG)  Center of Mass (COM)]]).

**Types of Balance:** Static (stationary) vs. Dynamic (moving).

**Training Methods:** Progressively challenge the systems involved:
- **Reduce Base of Support:** Narrow stance -> Tandem -> Single-leg.
- **Challenge Center of Gravity:** Reaching, weight shifts, perturbations.
- **Reduce Sensory Input:** Eyes closed, compliant surfaces (foam pads, balance discs - use judiciously).
- **Dynamic Movements:** Walking variations, lunges, step-ups with balance challenges, agility drills.
- **Coordination Drills:** Ladders, cones, reaction drills, complex limb timing exercises.
- **Strength Training:** Foundational strength (core, hips, ankles) provides stability. Unilateral exercises inherently challenge balance.

**Benefits:**
- Improved postural control & stability.
- Reduced fall risk ([[G2. Age-Specific Exercise Recommendations]]).
- Enhanced athletic performance (agility, landing mechanics).
- Injury prevention/rehabilitation (restores neuromuscular control after lower limb injuries - [[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]).

**Implementation:** Integrate into warm-ups, standalone sessions, or within strength training. Progress based on individual ability.
