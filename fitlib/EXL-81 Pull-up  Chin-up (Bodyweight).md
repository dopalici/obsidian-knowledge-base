### **EXL-81: Pull-up / Chin-up (Bodyweight)**

**ID:** EXL-81-BW-PULLUP **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental bodyweight upper-body pulling exercise [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] involving pulling the body upwards from a dead hang position until the chin clears the bar. Primarily targets the back and biceps. Variations include pull-ups (overhand grip) and chin-ups (underhand grip).

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires significant relative strength).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (Weight Belt/Vest) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pauses at top/mid-range).
- Grip Variations (Wide Pull-up, Narrow Pull-up, Neutral Grip Pull-up).
- Advanced Variations (Archer pull-ups, One-arm pull-up progressions, Muscle-ups [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]]).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Assisted Pull-up Machine [[EXL-65 Assisted Pull-upDip Machine]].
- Band Assisted Pull-ups [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Negative Pull-ups (focus only on the controlled lowering/eccentric phase).
- Jumping Pull-ups (use leg drive to assist).
- Lat Pulldowns [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]] / [[EXL-75 Cable Lat Pulldown (Various grips)]].
- Inverted Rows [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major, Biceps Brachii (especially chin-ups), Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle and Lower), Posterior Deltoid, Brachioradialis, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Pectoralis Minor, Abdominals (preventing excessive swing).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Grasp bar with desired grip (pull-up: overhand, typically shoulder-width or wider; chin-up: underhand, typically shoulder-width). Start from a dead hang (full elbow extension, shoulders relaxed or slightly engaged/depressed depending on philosophy). Engage core slightly to prevent excessive swinging.
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by depressing and retracting scapulae (pull shoulder blades down and back). Drive elbows down towards ribs, pulling chest towards the bar. Continue pulling until chin clears the bar. Focus on using back muscles. Control the descent (eccentric phase) back to the starting dead hang position, achieving full elbow extension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during the pull upwards (concentric), inhale during the descent (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum/kipping (unless specifically training kipping pull-ups), incomplete range of motion (not fully extending at bottom or getting chin over bar), forward head posture, shrugging shoulders towards ears.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Requires adequate shoulder mobility and stability [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]. Use caution if significantly overweight due to high joint stress.
- **Safety:** Ensure secure grip. Control the movement, especially the eccentric. Progress gradually using appropriate regressions if unable to perform full pull-ups.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed (bodyweight or with added load) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load added/assistance level used for specific reps/sets.
- Qualitative assessment of form (full ROM, minimal kipping, scapular control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
