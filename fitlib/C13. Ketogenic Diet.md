**ID:** C13-KETO-DIET **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

The ketogenic (keto) diet is characterized by very low carbohydrate intake, moderate protein, and very high fat intake. This macronutrient composition shifts the body's primary fuel source from glucose to ketones, produced from fat breakdown in the liver—a state known as nutritional ketosis [].

**Macronutrient Distribution:**

- **Carbohydrates:** Extremely low (<5-10% of calories, typically <50g/day, often <20-30g).
- **Fat:** Very high (≥70-80% of calories).
- **Protein:** Moderate (~15-25% of calories, ~1.2-1.7 g/kg). Must be controlled, as excess protein can be converted to glucose (gluconeogenesis) and inhibit ketosis.

**Mechanism:**

- Drastically reduced carbohydrate intake lowers blood glucose and insulin levels, depleting liver glycogen.
- Low insulin signals increased fat breakdown (lipolysis) and ketone body production (ketogenesis: beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, acetone) in the liver.
- Brain and other tissues adapt to utilize ketones as a major fuel source [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]].

**Potential Applications & Evidence:**

- **Epilepsy:** Established medical therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy, particularly in children.
- **Weight Loss:** Can be effective, primarily through appetite suppression (ketones, high fat/protein), reduced food choices, and initial water loss. Long-term effectiveness comparable to other energy-restricted diets when calories and protein are matched [].
- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Can significantly improve glycemic control and reduce medication dependency in some individuals. Requires careful monitoring.
- **Neurological Disorders:** Investigated for potential benefits in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etc., but evidence is preliminary.

**Fitness & Performance Considerations:**

- **Endurance Performance:** May benefit _some_ ultra-endurance athletes by dramatically increasing fat oxidation capacity ("fat adaptation"), potentially sparing glycogen. However, this adaptation takes weeks/months and often comes at the cost of reduced capacity for high-intensity work (impaired glycolysis), leading to compromised performance in events with higher intensity bursts or finishing sprints [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]. Meta-analyses show mixed results, often no benefit or decrement in typical endurance performance metrics (e.g., VO2max, time trials) [].
- **Strength/Power/Hypertrophy:** Generally considered suboptimal. The reliance on fat/ketones impairs fuel availability for high-intensity, glycolytic efforts typical in strength/power training and high-volume hypertrophy work [[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]]. While some studies show strength maintenance is possible, maximizing performance or muscle gain [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]] is likely compromised [].
- **Adaptation Period ("Keto Flu"):** Initial weeks often involve fatigue, headache, nausea, cognitive fog as the body adapts. Requires careful electrolyte management (sodium, potassium, magnesium) [[C5. Electrolytes]].

**Nutrient Considerations & Risks:**

- Requires careful planning to ensure adequate intake of fiber, electrolytes, and certain micronutrients often found in carb-rich foods (e.g., thiamin, folate, magnesium, potassium).
- Potential risks include kidney stones, unfavorable changes in blood lipids (especially LDL-C) in some individuals, constipation, and nutrient deficiencies if poorly formulated. Long-term health effects require more research.
