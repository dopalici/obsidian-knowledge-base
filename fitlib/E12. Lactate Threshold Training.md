### E12. Lactate Threshold Training
**ID:** E12-LACTATE-THRESHOLD-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Lactate threshold (LT) training aims to improve the exercise intensity at which lactate accumulation significantly increases (LT1/Aerobic Threshold) and/or the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS or LT2/Anaerobic Threshold). Improving LT allows athletes to sustain higher intensities/speeds aerobically for longer periods.

**Physiological Basis (related to [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]):** LT represents balance between lactate production (glycolysis) and clearance (oxidation/gluconeogenesis). Training improves clearance capacity (↑mitochondria, ↑MCT transporters) and tolerance.

**Effective Training Methods:**
- **Tempo/Threshold Training:** Sustained efforts at/slightly below LT2/MLSS intensity (~80-90% HRmax, Zone 3-4, RPE "comfortably hard"). Duration 20-60 min continuous or long intervals (e.g., 2-4 x 10-20 min) with short recovery.
- **Sweet Spot Training (Cycling):** Intensity slightly below FTP/LT2 (~88-94% FTP), allows substantial volume accumulation at challenging but sustainable intensity.
- **Extensive Aerobic Training (LISS - [[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]):** High volume low-intensity training improves aerobic base and LT1, supporting threshold training.

**Programming:** Typically 1-2 sessions/week. Intensity needs accurate determination (lab tests, field tests like FTP, HR/RPE estimation).

**Importance:** LT (esp. LT2/MLSS) often better predictor of endurance performance than VO2max alone, representing highest sustainable aerobic intensity.
