### **EXL-71: Cable Lateral Raise**

**ID:** EXL-71-CEX-LATRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the medial (side) deltoids. Involves abducting the arm out to the side against the constant tension of the cable. Typically performed one arm at a time.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Leaning Cable Lateral Raise (alters resistance profile).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Lateral Raise [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]].
- Resistance Band Lateral Raise [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Machine Lateral Raise [[EXL-53 Lateral Raise (Machine)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Medial Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Posterior Deltoid, Supraspinatus, Upper Trapezius (at top of ROM).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (especially Obliques on contralateral side), Scapular stabilizers, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach a D-handle to a low pulley cable. Stand sideways to the machine, grasping handle with the hand furthest from the machine (cable passes across front or behind body - slight variation). Stand upright, core engaged, slight bend in working elbow. Use non-working hand to hold onto machine for stability if needed.
- **Execution:** Exhale and raise arm out to the side in a wide arc, leading with elbow, until arm is approximately parallel to floor. Maintain slight elbow bend. Focus on using side deltoid. Avoid shrugging or leaning excessively. Pause briefly at top. Inhale and slowly lower handle back to starting position under control against cable tension. Complete reps for one side before switching.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/leaning, excessive shrugging (upper traps taking over), bending elbow too much, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled eccentric.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff). Constant tension may require lighter weight than dumbbell version initially.
- **Safety:** Use strict form, minimize momentum. Control the weight, especially the eccentric. Ensure stable stance.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, minimal shrugging, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
