### A20. Principle of Specificity (SAID)
**ID:** A20-PRINCIPLE-SPECIFICITY

*(Content based on FZC-1.2)*
The Principle of Specificity, often encapsulated by the acronym SAID (Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands), highlights that the body adapts very specifically to the type and nature of the stress placed upon it. Training effects are most pronounced in the systems, muscles, and movement patterns that are directly trained.

**Dimensions of Specificity:**
- **Metabolic/Energy System:** Endurance training primarily improves aerobic pathways ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]), while sprint training improves anaerobic pathways.
- **Muscle Fiber Type:** Training recruits specific fiber types based on intensity ([[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]]). Adaptations enhance characteristics of recruited fibers.
- **Movement Pattern/Skill:** Practicing a specific movement improves neural coordination and efficiency for *that specific movement*. Transfer depends on similarity.
- **Velocity of Movement:** Training velocity influences velocity-specific strength/power gains.
- **Type of Contraction:** Adaptations specific to isometric, concentric, or eccentric emphasis ([[B19. Isometrics]], [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- **Range of Motion (ROM):** Adaptations greatest within the trained ROM.

**Implications:** Training programs must target the specific adaptations required for the goal. Marathon training differs significantly from powerlifting training.
