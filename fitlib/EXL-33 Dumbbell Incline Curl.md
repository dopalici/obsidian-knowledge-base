### **EXL-33: Dumbbell Incline Curl**

**ID:** EXL-33-DB-INCLINECURL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise for the biceps performed seated on an incline bench. The inclined position places the shoulder in extension, putting a greater stretch on the long head of the biceps brachii, potentially enhancing its activation and stimulus.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good control and shoulder stability).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Incline Angle (lower angle increases stretch).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Seated Dumbbell Bicep Curl (less stretch, more stable).
- Standing Dumbbell Bicep Curl [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]].
- Cable Bicep Curl [[EXL-69 Cable Bicep Curl (BarHandles)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii (long head emphasized due to stretch), Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set incline bench to approximately 45-60 degrees. Sit back firmly against the pad, feet planted. Hold dumbbells with an underhand (supinated) grip, letting arms hang straight down, perpendicular to the floor. Shoulders should be pulled back slightly due to the incline.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary and perpendicular to the floor (or slightly behind the body), exhale and curl dumbbells upwards towards shoulders by flexing elbows. Focus on contracting biceps. Avoid letting elbows drift forward significantly. Pause briefly at the top. Inhale and slowly lower dumbbells back to the starting position under control, achieving full elbow extension and feeling the stretch.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/swinging, elbows drifting far forward, incomplete range of motion (not fully extending), shoulders rolling forward.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Anterior shoulder pain or instability, biceps tendinopathy. The stretched position can aggravate these conditions if not performed carefully.
- **Safety:** Ensure bench is stable. Use appropriate weight allowing strict form. Control the eccentric phase carefully due to the stretched position.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, full ROM, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
