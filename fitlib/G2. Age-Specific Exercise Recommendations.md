### G2. Age-Specific Exercise Recommendations
**ID:** G2-AGE-SPECIFIC-RECOMMENDATIONS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Exercise guidelines and considerations vary across the lifespan due to differences in physiology, development, health risks, and goals.

**Children (5-12 years):**
- **Focus:** Fundamental movement skills, motor coordination, bone health, enjoyment.
- **Guidelines ([WHO Guidelines, 2020]):** 60+ min/day MVPA, mostly aerobic. Vigorous & strengthening activities ≥3 days/week.
- **Considerations:** Emphasize play, variety. Avoid early specialization. Basic resistance training with bodyweight/light loads, focus on technique.

**Adolescents (13-17 years):**
- **Focus:** Skill development, fitness base, potentially increased specialization, lifelong habits.
- **Guidelines ([WHO Guidelines, 2020]):** Same as children (60+ min/day MVPA, vigorous & strengthening ≥3x/week).
- **Considerations:** Growth spurts affect coordination/injury risk. Structured resistance training with proper supervision. Address body image. High nutritional needs.

**Adults (18-64 years):**
- **Focus:** Maintaining/improving health-related fitness, preventing chronic disease, weight management, stress reduction.
- **Guidelines ([WHO Guidelines, 2020]; [ACSM Guidelines]):** 150-300 min moderate OR 75-150 min vigorous aerobic activity/week. Muscle-strengthening activities ≥2 days/week. Flexibility/mobility recommended.
- **Considerations:** Balance work/life demands. Progressive overload appropriate to status.

**Older Adults (65+ years):**
- **Focus:** Functional independence, fall prevention, managing chronic conditions, preserving muscle/bone mass, cognitive health.
- **Guidelines ([WHO Guidelines, 2020]; [ACSM/NSCA Position Stands]):** Same aerobic/strength guidelines as adults, *plus* multicomponent activity emphasizing functional balance and strength ≥3 days/week.
- **Considerations:** Higher protein needs (~1.2-1.6+ g/kg - [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]). Modify for safety/limitations. Power training important. Start low, progress slow. Address fear of falling.
