### **EXL-97: Stair Climber / Stepmill**

**ID:** EXL-97-CARDIO-STAIRCLIMBER **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A cardiovascular machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] simulating climbing stairs. Stepmills have revolving steps, while stair steppers have independent pedals. Provides a high-intensity, low-impact (compared to running) workout targeting the lower body and cardiovascular system.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (can be very demanding cardiovascularly and muscularly).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Speed (Steps Per Minute) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Resistance Level (if applicable on stepper type).
- Avoid holding handrails (increases difficulty/core engagement).
- Perform intervals [[E4. Interval Training (General)]].
- Skip steps (advanced variation, increases ROM).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Speed.
- Decrease Duration.
- Use handrails lightly for balance/support.
- Choose less intense cardio options like Elliptical [[EXL-92 Elliptical Trainer]] or Bike [[EXL-93 Stationary Bike (Upright)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves. Significant cardiovascular challenge.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hip stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]] (General Posture)

- **Setup:** Step onto machine, select program or manual mode. Start at slow speed.
- **Execution:** Step continuously, maintaining upright posture. Engage core. Drive through entire foot. Avoid leaning heavily on handrails â€“ use only lightly for balance if needed. Maintain consistent pace.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing appropriate for intensity.
- **Common Faults:** Leaning heavily on handrails (significantly reduces workout intensity), poor posture (slouching), looking down excessively.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries/pain (can aggravate patellofemoral pain or arthritis), significant balance issues. Can be very demanding cardiovascularly, caution advised for individuals with certain heart conditions, [[Q5. Exercise Considerations for Health Conditions Overview]].
- **Safety:** Be cautious when getting on/off revolving steps. Start slowly. Use handrails initially if needed for balance, but aim to reduce reliance. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Speed (Steps Per Minute or Levels), Floors Climbed (estimated) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
