### **EXL-14: Barbell Bicep Curl**

**ID:** EXL-14-BB-BICEPCURL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental isolation exercise using a barbell to target the biceps brachii and other elbow flexors through elbow flexion while standing. Allows for potentially heavier loads than dumbbell curls.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Grip Width Variations (Wider = more short head emphasis; Narrower = more long head emphasis - subtle).
- Preacher Curls (Barbell or Machine [[EXL-60 Bicep Curl (Machine - Preacher or Seated)]]).
- Cheat Curls (using slight momentum for overload - advanced technique, use sparingly).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Use EZ-Curl Bar (often more comfortable on wrists).
- Dumbbell Bicep Curls [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]].
- Cable Curls [[EXL-69 Cable Bicep Curl (BarHandles)]].
- Resistance Band Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pulling movements (Rows, Chin-ups [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Anterior Deltoid, Wrist Flexors. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand upright, feet shoulder-width, core engaged, slight knee bend. Grip barbell with underhand (supinated) grip, typically shoulder-width apart. Let bar hang at arm's length, elbows close to torso. Good posture.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary and pinned to sides, exhale and curl barbell upwards towards shoulders by flexing elbows. Focus on contracting biceps. Avoid swinging torso or using momentum. Pause briefly at top. Inhale and slowly lower barbell back to starting position under control, achieving full elbow extension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive body swing/momentum ("cheating"), elbows moving forward, incomplete range of motion (especially at bottom), leaning back excessively.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries. Straight bar can cause wrist discomfort for some; EZ-curl bar is an alternative [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form, minimize momentum. Control eccentric phase. Use appropriate weight. Keep elbows tucked.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load with strict form.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, stable upper arms, full ROM).
