### A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
**ID:** A2-BMR-TDEE
**Created:** 2025-04-23

BMR is the minimum energy required to sustain vital functions at complete rest (post-absorptive state, thermoneutral environment). Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is similar but less strict conditions, often slightly higher. TDEE encompasses all daily energy expenditure.

**TDEE Components:**
- **BMR/RMR:** Largest component (~60-75% of TDEE), influenced by body size, composition (FFM is primary driver), age, sex, genetics, hormones (thyroid).
- **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** Energy cost of digestion, absorption, metabolism of food (~10% of TDEE, varies by macronutrient: Protein ~20-30%, Carbs ~5-10%, Fat ~0-3%).
- **Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT):** Energy expended during planned physical activity/exercise (highly variable, ~15-30% or more).
- **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):** Energy expended for activities not related to sleep, eating, or planned exercise (e.g., fidgeting, walking, posture maintenance). Highly variable between individuals, significant factor in TDEE differences and obesity risk (Levine JA, 2002).

**Estimation Methods:**
- Harris-Benedict Equation (original and revised)
- Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (often considered more accurate for general population)
- Katch-McArdle Formula (requires lean body mass estimate, good for athletes)
- Cunningham Equation (also uses lean body mass)
- *Note:* Indirect calorimetry (measuring O2 consumption/CO2 production) is the gold standard for measuring RMR. Equations provide estimates.
