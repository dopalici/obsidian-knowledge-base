### **EXL-06: Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)**

**ID:** EXL-06-BB-ROW-PRONATED **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A compound free weight exercise involving pulling a barbell towards the torso while maintaining a bent-over, hip-hinged position with a neutral spine, using an overhand (pronated) grip. Effectively builds strength and hypertrophy in the upper and mid-back musculature, lats, and biceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires ability to maintain a strong hip hinge and neutral spine under load, plus significant core stability).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Pendlay Row [[EXL-17 Pendlay Row]] (Stricter form, bar resets on floor).
- Yates Row (Underhand Grip) [[EXL-18 Yates Row (Underhand Barbell Row)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Rows [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]] / [[EXL-28 Dumbbell Bench Supported Row (Chest Supported)]].
- Seated Cable Rows  [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]].
- Machine Rows [[EXL-57 Seated Row (Machine - Close GripNeutral)]] / [[EXL-58 Chest Supported Row (Machine)]].
- Inverted Rows [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Improve hip hinge mechanics [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] & core stability [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (Middle & Lower), Rhomboids, Teres Major.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Erector Spinae (isometric stabilization).
- **Stabilizers:** Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus (isometric hold), Core musculature, Forearm flexors (grip). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-to-shoulder width apart, mid-foot under bar. Grip bar with an overhand (pronated) grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width. Hinge at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]], keeping knees slightly bent, until torso is near-parallel to floor. Maintain neutral spine (flat back). Let arms hang straight.
- **Execution:** Brace core [[L4. Core Stability Training]]. Initiate pull by retracting scapulae. Pull barbell towards lower chest/upper abdomen, leading with elbows. Keep elbows tucked closer to the body than in a Yates row (approx 45-60 degrees). Squeeze back muscles at the top. Avoid using excessive momentum or lifting torso significantly. Lower bar under control back to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric), or use Valsalva briefly for heavy reps.
- **Common Faults:** Rounding lower back, using excessive body swing ("hip heave"), pulling bar too high (towards upper chest/neck), shrugging shoulders, incomplete range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injuries (disc issues, strains). Requires strong ability to maintain neutral spine under load. Not ideal for those with poor hip hinge mechanics initially [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Master hip hinge first. Prioritize neutral spine. Control the weight. Avoid jerky movements. Use appropriate load.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (spinal posture, minimal momentum, pull height, elbow position).
