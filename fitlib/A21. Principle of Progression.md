*(Content based on FZC-1.3)*
The Principle of Progression builds directly upon the Principle of Overload ([[A19. Principle of Overload]]). It states that as the body adapts to a specific training stimulus, that stimulus must be gradually and systematically increased over time to continue eliciting positive adaptations. If the training load remains constant after adaptation has occurred, progress will stall (plateau).

**Methods of Progression (see [[B1. Progressive Overload]]):** Increasing load, volume, frequency, density, complexity.

**Rate and Pattern:** Non-linear (faster initially, slows over time - [[A24. Principle of Diminishing Returns]]), systematic (planned), individualized ([[A23. Principle of Individuality]]). Monitoring response ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]) is crucial. Improper progression risks stagnation, overtraining ([[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]]), or injury ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]).
