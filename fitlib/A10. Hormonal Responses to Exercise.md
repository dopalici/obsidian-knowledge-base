### A10. Hormonal Responses to Exercise
**ID:** A10-HORMONAL-RESPONSES
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Exercise triggers acute and chronic hormonal changes influencing metabolism, recovery, and adaptation.

**Acute Responses (During/Post-Exercise):**
- **Catabolic (Fuel Mobilization/Stress):** ↑ Catecholamines (Epi/Norepi), ↑ Cortisol (mod-high intensity/duration), ↑ Glucagon.
- **Anabolic/Growth-Related:** ↑ Growth Hormone (esp. with metabolic stress/RT), ↑ Testosterone (transiently with heavy RT), ↑ IGF-1.
- **Other:** ↓ Insulin (exercise increases sensitivity via non-insulin pathways), ↑ Endorphins.

**Chronic Adaptations (Training Effects):**
- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Key benefit.
- **Altered Basal Levels:** Minor changes usually. Chronic high stress/LEA can suppress anabolic hormones (T, E), elevate cortisol ([[I1. Training and Hormonal Responses]], [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]).
- **Attenuated Acute Response:** Blunted catecholamine/cortisol response to same *absolute* workload indicates improved efficiency.

**Factors Influencing:** Intensity, duration, type, volume, muscle mass, training status, nutrition, sleep, stress, age, sex.
