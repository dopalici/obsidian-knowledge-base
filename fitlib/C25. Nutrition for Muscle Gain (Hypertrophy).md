Optimizing nutrition for muscle hypertrophy [[B3. Hypertrophy Training Principles]] involves strategies primarily aimed at supporting muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and providing adequate energy for training and tissue growth [].

**Key Nutritional Requirements:**

1. **Consistent Energy Surplus:** A positive energy balance is generally required to maximize muscle gain [[A1. Energy Balance]]. A modest surplus of **~10-20% above TDEE** (approx. 250-500 kcal/day) is recommended to optimize the muscle gain to fat gain ratio [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]], [[H2. Realistic Muscle Gain Rates]]. Excessive surpluses lead primarily to fat accumulation [].
2. **Sufficient Protein Intake:** Essential to provide amino acids for MPS. Target **1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight per day** [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]. Distributing this intake across 4-5 meals/snacks (0.3-0.5 g/kg per meal) is likely optimal for maximizing the MPS response over 24 hours [[C3. Nutrient Timing]]. Focus on high-quality sources rich in leucine.
3. **Adequate Carbohydrate Intake:** Provides the primary fuel for resistance training sessions, allowing for sufficient training volume and intensity [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]]. Also helps replenish glycogen stores and may support an anabolic environment (via insulin). Intake typically ranges from **3-6+ g/kg/day** depending on training volume, overall energy needs, and individual preference [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]].
4. **Adequate Fat Intake:** Essential for hormone production and overall health. Typically **20-35% of total calories**, ensuring sufficient essential fatty acids [[A3. Macronutrients]].
5. **Nutrient Timing:** While less critical than total daily intake, consuming protein and carbohydrates around the training window (e.g., within a few hours pre- and post-exercise) may offer small advantages for recovery and adaptation [[C3. Nutrient Timing]], [[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]]. Pre-sleep protein (~30-40g casein) can enhance overnight MPS [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]].
6. **Supplements:** **Creatine monohydrate** (3-5g/day) consistently shows benefits for increasing lean mass and performance when combined with resistance training [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]. Protein supplements can be a convenient way to meet daily targets.

**Implementation:**

- Requires consistent adherence to caloric surplus and protein targets.
- Monitor rate of weight gain (~0.25-0.5% body weight per week is a reasonable target to prioritize lean mass) and adjust calories as needed [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Pair nutritional strategies with a well-designed resistance training program emphasizing progressive overload [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
