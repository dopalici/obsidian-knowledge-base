### **EXL-48: Seated Leg Curl (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-48-MEX-LEGCURL-SEATED **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]], involving flexing the knees against resistance while seated. Primarily targets the hamstring muscles.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Leg Leg Curl (addresses imbalances).
- Lying Leg Curl (Machine) [[EXL-49 Lying Leg Curl (Machine)]] (slightly different feel/activation).
- Progress to free weight exercises like RDLs [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] / [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]], Glute-Ham Raises [[EXL-87 Glute-Ham Raise (GHR)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Hamstring Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Stability Ball Hamstring Curls [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] (less direct hamstring isolation).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris - short & long heads, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Gastrocnemius (assists knee flexion), Popliteus, Sartorius, Gracilis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hip Flexors (to maintain seated position).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust machine settings (back pad, ankle pad) so knee joint aligns with machine's axis of rotation and ankle pad rests comfortably just above the ankles/shoes. Sit securely with back flat against pad, often gripping handles for stability.
- **Execution:** Exhale and flex knees, curling the ankle pad towards the glutes smoothly. Focus on contracting the hamstrings. Control the movement through the full range of motion available. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly return the pad to the starting position under control (eccentric phase), avoiding letting the weight stack touch down between reps to maintain tension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during knee flexion (concentric), inhale during knee extension (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum, lifting hips off the seat, incomplete range of motion (not fully contracting or extending), uncontrolled eccentric phase.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute hamstring strain, significant knee injury (requires clearance). Be mindful of lower back position.
- **Safety:** Ensure machine is adjusted properly for individual limb lengths. Use appropriate weight that allows for controlled movement through full ROM. Avoid hyperextending the knee at the start/end position.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Time under tension.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
