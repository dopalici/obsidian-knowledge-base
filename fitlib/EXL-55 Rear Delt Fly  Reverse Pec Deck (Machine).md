### **EXL-55: Rear Delt Fly / Reverse Pec Deck (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-55-MEX-REARDELTFLY **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a Pec Deck machine [[B10. Machine Training]] adapted for reverse flyes, or on a dedicated reverse fly machine. It targets the posterior deltoids and upper back muscles by moving the arms horizontally backward (abduction/extension) against resistance.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cable Rear Delt Fly / Reverse Fly [[B10. Machine Training]].
- Dumbbell Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise [[EXL-26 Dumbbell Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise]].
- Face Pulls [[EXL-73 Cable Face Pull]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Pull-Aparts [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound rowing movements [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Posterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle), Infraspinatus, Teres Minor.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so shoulders align with handles/pads when arms are forward. Sit facing the machine (reverse of Pec Deck) with chest against pad. Grip handles with neutral or pronated grip, arms extended forward or slightly bent. Maintain upright posture, shoulders down.
- **Execution:** Exhale and move arms backward horizontally in a wide arc, squeezing shoulder blades together and focusing on contracting rear deltoids and upper back muscles. Keep torso stable against pad. Maintain slight bend in elbows. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly return arms to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during backward movement (concentric), inhale during forward return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum, shrugging shoulders, bending elbows excessively, incomplete range of motion, lifting chest off pad.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries. Ensure machine is set up properly to avoid awkward joint angles.
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight allowing strict form and control. Focus on squeezing target muscles rather than moving maximal weight. Avoid slamming weight stack.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, scapular movement, minimal momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
