### **EXL-86: Back Extension / Hyperextension (Bench)**

**ID:** EXL-86-BW-BACKEXT _(Note: This duplicates EXL-19 from the list, confirming placement here)_ **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An exercise targeting the spinal erectors, glutes, and hamstrings, typically performed on a 45-degree hyperextension bench or a glute-ham raise (GHR) apparatus [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]]. Involves hinging at the hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] to lower the torso and extending the hips/spine to return to the start.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (holding weight plate/dumbbell against chest) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Increase Range of Motion (if appropriate).
- Progress to Good Mornings [[EXL-10 Barbell Good Morning]].
- Progress to Romanian Deadlifts [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] / [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].
- Glute-Ham Raise [[EXL-87 Glute-Ham Raise (GHR)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Use Bodyweight only [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Reduce Range of Motion.
- Bird Dog exercise [[L4. Core Stability Training]].
- Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Superman exercise (prone on floor).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Erector Spinae group, Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Latissimus Dorsi.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust pad height on apparatus so hips are just clear of the pad, allowing free hinging at the hip joint. Secure ankles/calves under pads. Cross arms over chest or place hands behind head (avoid pulling on neck). Maintain neutral spine initially.
- **Execution:** Inhale and hinge forward at the hips, lowering torso towards floor while keeping back straight (neutral spine). Movement comes from hip flexion, not spinal flexion (avoid rounding back). Lower until a stretch is felt in hamstrings or torso is near perpendicular to legs (depending on flexibility/goal). Exhale and extend hips and spine simultaneously to return to starting position. Squeeze glutes and spinal erectors at the top. Avoid excessive hyperextension of the spine at the top; aim for a straight line from head to heels.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering (eccentric), exhale during raising (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rounding the lower back during descent, excessive hyperextension at the top, initiating movement with spinal flexion instead of hip hinge, jerky movements.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back pain/injury (especially extension-sensitive conditions like spondylolisthesis or facet joint issues). Requires careful control and avoidance of extreme ranges.
- **Safety:** Ensure apparatus is adjusted correctly and stable. Maintain neutral spine throughout. Control the movement, avoid momentum. Do not hyperextend excessively at the top.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Reps performed (bodyweight or specific load) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load added for specific reps/sets.
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip hinge pattern, spinal neutrality, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
