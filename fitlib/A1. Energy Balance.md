### A1. Energy Balance
**ID:** A1-ENERGY-BALANCE
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Energy balance describes the relationship between energy intake (EI - calories consumed) and energy expenditure (EE - calories burned). It dictates changes in body mass according to the First Law of Thermodynamics.

- **Caloric Surplus (EI > EE):** Leads to weight gain (storage of excess energy, primarily as fat, but also lean tissue in the presence of appropriate stimulus like resistance training).
- **Caloric Deficit (EI < EE):** Leads to weight loss (mobilization of stored energy, primarily fat, but potentially lean tissue without adequate protein/stimulus).
- **Energy Balance (EI = EE):** Leads to weight maintenance.
- **Energy Availability (EA):** A more nuanced concept, especially for athletes, representing dietary energy remaining for physiological function after accounting for exercise energy expenditure (EEE), normalized to fat-free mass (FFM). EA = (EI - EEE) / FFM. Low EA (<30-35 kcal/kg FFM/day) impairs health and performance ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]).
