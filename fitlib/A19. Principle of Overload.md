*(Content based on FZC-1.1)*
The Principle of Overload is the cornerstone of all physiological adaptation to exercise. It states that for the body to improve its function (e.g., increase strength, muscle size, endurance capacity), it must be subjected to a training stress (load, stimulus) that is greater than what it is currently accustomed to. This overload disrupts the body's internal balance (homeostasis), signaling the need for adaptation to better handle that stress in the future.

**Methods of Applying Overload:**
- **Intensity:** Increasing the resistance/weight lifted (%1RM), running/cycling speed, incline, or perceived exertion (RPE).
- **Volume:** Increasing the total amount of work performed, typically by adding repetitions, sets, or increasing the duration/frequency of sessions.
- **Density:** Increasing the amount of work done within a given time period, usually by decreasing rest intervals between sets or exercises.
- **Frequency:** Increasing the number of training sessions per week for a specific muscle group or activity (must be balanced with recovery).
- **Complexity:** Progressing to more challenging exercise variations requiring greater skill or stability.

**Progressive Overload:** This principle must be applied progressively over time ([[A21. Principle of Progression]]). As the body adapts, the *same* stimulus no longer constitutes an overload. Therefore, the training stress must be systematically increased to continue driving adaptation. Insufficient overload leads to stagnation; excessive overload applied too quickly or without adequate recovery leads to maladaptation, burnout, or injury ([[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]]).
