### **EXL-54: Pec Deck Fly (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-54-MEX-PECDECK **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] targeting the pectoralis major muscles. Involves bringing the arms together horizontally (adduction) against resistance provided by pads or handles.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cable Crossovers / Flyes [[EXL-66 Cable Crossover  Fly]] (less stability, constant tension).
- Dumbbell Flyes [[B8. Free Weights (Barbells, Dumbbells)]] (different resistance curve, requires more control).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Chest Flyes [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pressing movements [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]], [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]], [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]], [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major (sternal and clavicular heads).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Coracobrachialis, Biceps Brachii (short head - weak adductor).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers (Rhomboids, Middle Traps - controlling retraction), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so handles/pads align with mid-chest level when arms are abducted. Sit with back firmly against pad. Place forearms/hands against pads or grip handles (depending on machine type) with elbows slightly bent. Maintain good posture, shoulders down and back slightly.
- **Execution:** Exhale and slowly bring arms together in a wide arc, adducting the shoulders and focusing on squeezing the pectoral muscles. Maintain slight bend in elbows. Pause briefly at peak contraction when pads/handles meet or are close together. Inhale and slowly reverse the motion under control, allowing arms to abduct back to starting position, feeling a stretch across chest. Avoid overstretching.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during adduction (concentric), inhale during abduction/return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive weight leading to poor form/shoulder rolling forward, incomplete range of motion (not fully contracting or stretching), uncontrolled eccentric phase, shrugging shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff, AC joint), history of shoulder dislocations. Can aggravate shoulder issues if range of motion is excessive or form is poor.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat/pad adjustment. Control the weight throughout the movement. Avoid overstretching the shoulder joint at the start/end position. Use appropriate weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, shoulder position) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
