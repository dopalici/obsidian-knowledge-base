### **EXL-13: Barbell Skullcrusher (Lying Triceps Extension)**

**ID:** EXL-13-BB-SKULLCRUSHER **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise for the triceps performed lying on a bench, involving lowering a barbell towards the forehead by bending the elbows and extending them back up.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires careful control to avoid elbow/wrist strain).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]] (use EZ-curl bar if straight bar causes wrist discomfort).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at extension).
- Decline Skullcrushers (alters resistance curve).
- Progress to Close-Grip Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]] or Dips [[EXL-82 Dip (Parallel Bar)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Skullcrushers / Lying Triceps Extensions (allows more natural wrist position).
- Overhead Dumbbell Triceps Extension [[EXL-35 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)]].
- Cable Triceps Pushdown [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]].
- Bodyweight Triceps Extensions (using bench/bar).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (all three heads, long head emphasized due to shoulder position).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Shoulders (Deltoids, Rotator Cuff - isometric hold), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]]. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie flat on bench, feet planted. Hold barbell (straight or EZ-curl) with overhand grip, narrower than shoulder-width. Start with bar extended straight above chest/shoulders, arms perpendicular to floor. Keep upper arms relatively stationary throughout movement.
- **Execution:** Inhale and slowly lower the bar towards the forehead by bending only at the elbows. Keep upper arms vertical or angled slightly back towards head. Lower until bar is close to forehead or just behind head (range depends on comfort/mobility). Exhale and extend elbows, pressing the bar back to the starting position using triceps strength. Focus on keeping upper arms stable.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering (eccentric), exhale during extension (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Moving upper arms excessively (turning it into pullover motion), flaring elbows too wide, using momentum, incomplete range of motion, lowering bar too fast.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Elbow tendinopathy or pain. Can be stressful on elbows if performed improperly or with too much weight [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]]. EZ-curl bar often preferred for wrist comfort.
- **Safety:** Use a spotter, especially with heavier weight. Control the weight meticulously â€“ do not let it drop onto face. Keep upper arms stable. Start with lighter weight to master form.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, controlled movement, elbow position).
