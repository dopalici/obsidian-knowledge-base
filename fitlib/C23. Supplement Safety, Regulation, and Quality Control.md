**ID:** C23-SUPPLEMENT-SAFETY **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Ensuring supplement safety and quality is paramount due to regulatory differences compared to pharmaceuticals and documented issues with contamination and inaccurate labeling [].

**Regulatory Landscape (Varies by Country, e.g., USA - DSHEA 1994):**

- Supplements are generally regulated as foods, not drugs.
- Manufacturers are responsible for safety and labeling _before_ marketing; pre-market approval by regulatory bodies (like the FDA in the US) is typically **not** required.
- Regulatory agencies often act _reactively_ to address safety issues after products are on the market.
- Claims are restricted (structure/function claims allowed, disease claims prohibited without approval).

**Potential Risks:**

- **Contamination:** A significant concern. Products may contain undeclared substances, including:
    - Banned substances (anabolic steroids, stimulants, diuretics - major risk for tested athletes [[P2. Performance Enhancement Ethics]]).
    - Prescription medications.
    - Heavy metals or other toxins.
    - Allergens.
- **Inaccurate Labeling:** Actual ingredient amounts can differ substantially from the label (either less or more).
- **Adverse Effects:** Ingredients themselves might cause side effects or interact with medications.
- **Lack of Efficacy:** Many products make claims unsupported by scientific evidence [[J3. Misinformation in Fitness]].

**Minimizing Risk - Quality Control:**

- **Third-Party Certification:** The most reliable way to reduce risk. Independent organizations test products for contaminants, banned substances, and verify label claims/potency. Look for reputable certification marks on products:
    - **NSF Certified for Sport®:** Rigorous testing for 270+ banned substances, contaminants, and label verification. Widely recognized in sports.
    - **Informed Sport / Informed Choice:** Batch tests products for substances banned by WADA.
    - **BSCG (Banned Substances Control Group):** Tests for banned substances in sport plus prescription/OTC drugs.
    - **USP Verified:** Verifies ingredient identity, potency, purity, and good manufacturing practices (less focus on banned substances specifically).
- **Reputable Brands:** Choose well-established companies adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).
- **Simple Formulas:** Be cautious with proprietary blends hiding ingredient amounts.
- **Research:** Investigate evidence for ingredients [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]], [[C22. Supplements with LimitedMixed Evidence (Group B)]].
- **Professional Guidance:** Consult with knowledgeable sports dietitians or physicians [[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching]].
- **Check Prohibited Lists:** Athletes must verify all substances against the current WADA (or relevant governing body) Prohibited List. Remember _strict liability_ applies.

**Key Message:** No supplement is 100% risk-free regarding contamination or adverse effects. Third-party certification significantly _reduces_ but does not eliminate risk.
