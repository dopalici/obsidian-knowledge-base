### **EXL-31: Dumbbell Hammer Curl**

**ID:** EXL-31-DB-HAMMERCURL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An elbow flexion exercise similar to a standard bicep curl, but performed with a neutral (palms facing torso) grip throughout the movement. This grip emphasizes the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles more than the biceps brachii.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cross-Body Hammer Curl (curling dumbbell towards opposite shoulder).
- Rope Hammer Curl (using cables) [[EXL-70 Cable Hammer Curl (Rope)]].
- Seated Hammer Curls (stricter).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Hammer Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pulling exercises (Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]], Pull-ups/Pulldowns [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]], [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Biceps Brachii.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Anterior Deltoid, Wrist Flexors/Extensors.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand or sit upright, core engaged. Hold dumbbells at sides with palms facing torso (neutral/hammer grip). Elbows tucked close to sides. Maintain good posture.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary, exhale and curl dumbbells upwards towards shoulders, maintaining neutral grip. Focus on contracting elbow flexors. Pause briefly at top. Inhale and slowly lower dumbbells back to starting position under control, achieving full elbow extension. Can be performed alternating [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]] or simultaneously.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/swinging, elbows moving forward, incomplete range of motion, rotating wrists (losing neutral grip).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form, especially keeping upper arms stable. Control the weight. Use appropriate load.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load with strict form.
- Qualitative assessment of form (neutral grip maintenance, stable upper arms) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
