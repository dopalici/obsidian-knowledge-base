### E13. Heart Rate Zone Training
**ID:** E13-HR-ZONE-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Heart rate zone training uses heart rate (HR) ranges, typically expressed as a percentage of maximum heart rate (HRmax) or threshold heart rate (LTHR), to guide exercise intensity and target specific physiological systems.

**Determining Zones:** Estimate HRmax (220-age = poor estimate; field/lab test better) or determine LTHR (field/lab test). Calculate zones based on %HRmax or %LTHR using established models (e.g., Karvonen, Coggan).

**Common Zone Models (Examples - specific % vary):**
- **Zone 1 (Recovery):** <~70% HRmax / <~85% LTHR. Very light effort.
- **Zone 2 (Aerobic/Endurance):** ~70-80% HRmax / ~85-90% LTHR. Conversational pace. Builds aerobic base ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]).
- **Zone 3 (Tempo/Moderate):** ~80-87% HRmax / ~90-95% LTHR. "Comfortably hard." Near LT1 to Sweet Spot.
- **Zone 4 (Threshold):** ~88-94% HRmax / ~95-105% LTHR. Intensity around LT2/MLSS ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]). Difficult to sustain.
- **Zone 5 (VO2 Max/Anaerobic):** >95% HRmax / >105% LTHR. Very hard to maximal effort. Short intervals ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]).

**Pros:** Accessible (requires HR monitor), objective intensity guide.
**Cons:** HR affected by heat, hydration, stress, caffeine, cardiac drift; lag in HR response; HRmax estimation errors; individual variability in zone boundaries relative to physiological thresholds.

**Best Practice:** Use with RPE and potentially power/pace zones. Individualize zones based on testing. Chest strap HRM recommended for accuracy during exercise ([[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
