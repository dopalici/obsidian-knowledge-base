### **EXL-20: Barbell Calf Raise**

**ID:** EXL-20-BB-CALFRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An exercise targeting the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) through ankle plantarflexion while standing and supporting a barbell across the upper back.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires balance and ability to handle barbell loading).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top/bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Perform on one leg (requires significant balance/lighter load).
- Increase Range of Motion (stand on elevated surface like weight plate or block).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use empty bar.
- Standing Calf Raise Machine [[EXL-61 Calf Raise (Machine - Standing)]] (provides stability).
- Dumbbell Calf Raises [[EXL-42 Dumbbell Calf Raise (Standing)]] (easier setup/balance).
- Bodyweight Calf Raises [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Seated Calf Raises [[EXL-62 Calf Raise (Machine - Seated)]] (focuses on soleus).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gastrocnemius (emphasized with knee straight), Soleus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Tibialis Posterior, Peroneus Longus/Brevis, Flexor Hallucis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Longus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Upper Back (supporting bar), Muscles controlling foot/ankle stability [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place barbell across upper back (similar to high bar squat position [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]]). Stand with balls of feet on floor (or preferably on an elevated surface like a plate/block for greater ROM), heels hanging off if elevated. Maintain upright posture, core engaged, knees straight or with very slight bend.
- **Execution:** Lower heels towards floor slowly, achieving a full stretch in calves. Push forcefully through balls of feet to raise heels as high as possible (plantarflexion), squeezing calves at top. Control the descent slowly back to the stretched position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during heel raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Bouncing at bottom, incomplete range of motion, bending knees significantly, poor balance, rolling ankles.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute ankle/foot injuries, Achilles tendinopathy (requires careful loading). Balance issues may make this variation difficult [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Ensure stable footing, especially if using elevated surface. Control movement, avoid bouncing. Using a squat rack to unrack/rerack the bar is safest.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load or bodyweight.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, balance).
