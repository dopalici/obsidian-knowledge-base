### IX-3. Basic Injury Management (Acute Phase)
**ID:** IX-3-INJURY-MANAGEMENT
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Appropriate management in the immediate aftermath (acute phase, first ~24-72 hours) of a soft tissue musculoskeletal injury (strain, sprain, contusion) can influence pain, swelling, and potentially the initial stages of healing. Traditional RICE protocol has evolved to PEACE & LOVE.

**Immediately Post-Injury (PEACE):**
- **P - Protection:** Unload/restrict movement (1-3 days) to minimize bleeding/aggravation.
- **E - Elevation:** Raise limb above heart to promote fluid drainage.
- **A - Avoid Anti-inflammatory Modalities:** Avoid NSAIDs/ice initially? Inflammation is part of healing; suppressing it *may* impair long-term repair (evidence evolving). Ice mainly for *analgesia* (pain relief).
- **C - Compression:** Elastic bandage to limit swelling/hemorrhage.
- **E - Education:** Understand condition, benefits of active recovery, load management.

**Subsequent Management (After first few days - LOVE):**
- **L - Load:** Gradual mechanical stress within pain tolerance stimulates healing/remodeling (Optimal Loading). Avoid complete rest.
- **O - Optimism:** Positive patient expectations linked to better outcomes. Address fear-avoidance ([[F4. Behavioral Psychology in Fitness]]).
- **V - Vascularisation:** Early pain-free cardiovascular activity increases blood flow.
- **E - Exercise:** Active approach restoring mobility, strength, proprioception early in rehab.

**When to Seek Professional Help:** Inability to bear weight, significant swelling/deformity, joint instability, nerve symptoms, severe pain, no improvement after several days.
