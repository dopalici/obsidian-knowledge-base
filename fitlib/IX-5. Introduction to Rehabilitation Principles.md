### IX-5. Introduction to Rehabilitation Principles
**ID:** IX-5-REHAB-PRINCIPLES
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Rehabilitation following musculoskeletal injury is a systematic, progressive process aimed at restoring function, reducing pain, promoting tissue healing, and preventing re-injury, ultimately facilitating a safe return to desired activities or sport. It requires a criteria-based progression guided by tissue healing timelines and functional milestones.

**Phases of Rehabilitation (General Framework - Overlapping & Individualized):**
1.  **Acute/Protection Phase (Inflammation ~Days 1-7):** Minimize inflammation effects, protect tissue, maintain surrounding function. Interventions: PEACE & LOVE ([[IX-3. Basic Injury Management (Acute Phase)]]), relative rest, pain management, gentle pain-free ROM, isometrics.
2.  **Subacute/Repair Phase (Proliferation ~Day 3 to Week ~6+):** Promote healing, restore ROM, initiate controlled loading, restore neuromuscular control. Interventions: Progress ROM, light resistance (Optimal Loading), proprioception/balance ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]), CV fitness maintenance. Monitor pain/swelling response.
3.  **Remodeling/Maturation Phase (Week ~3-6+ to Months/Year+):** Promote optimal tissue remodeling, restore full strength/endurance/power, neuromuscular control, sport-specific skills. Interventions: Progressive resistance training ([[B1. Progressive Overload]]), advanced proprioception/balance, sport-specific drills, plyometrics, gradual increase in training volume/intensity. Address underlying biomechanical factors.

**Key Rehabilitation Principles:**
- **Criteria-Based Progression:** Advance based on functional milestones/criteria, not just time.
- **Individualization:** Tailor to injury, tissue, severity, goals, response.
- **Holistic Approach:** Address injured tissue, surrounding areas, CV fitness, psychological factors ([[F4. Behavioral Psychology in Fitness]]).
- **Active Approach:** Emphasize exercise/movement over passive modalities.
- **Load Management:** Careful progression of load crucial.
- **Pain Monitoring:** Use pain as a guide, but not sole factor.
- **Communication & Education:** Collaboration (therapist, patient, coach). Educate patient.

**Role of Professionals:** Physical therapists, athletic trainers, physicians guide diagnosis, rehab progression, manual therapy, return-to-activity decisions.
