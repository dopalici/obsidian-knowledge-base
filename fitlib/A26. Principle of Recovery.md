### A26. Principle of Recovery
**ID:** A26-PRINCIPLE-RECOVERY
**Created:** 2025-04-25

The Principle of Recovery emphasizes that adaptation to training occurs *during* periods of rest and recovery, not during the training itself. Training provides the stimulus, but adequate recovery (sleep, nutrition, rest days, stress management) is required for the body to repair damage, replenish energy stores, synthesize new proteins, and supercompensate (adapt beyond baseline). Insufficient recovery leads to fatigue accumulation, impaired adaptation, increased injury risk, and potential overreaching/overtraining.

**Components of Recovery:** See Section [[M. Recovery Strategies]], [[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]], [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]], [[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]] (Rest Days/Deloads discussed within), [[M3. Stress Management and Performance]].

**Implications:** Recovery must be planned and prioritized as an integral part of the training process, not an afterthought. Training load must be balanced with recovery capacity.
