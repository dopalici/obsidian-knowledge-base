### B19. Isometrics
**ID:** B19-ISOMETRICS
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Isometric training involves muscle contractions where muscle length does not change, and there is no visible joint movement. Force is produced against an immovable object or by co-contraction.

**Types:**
- **Yielding Isometrics (Holding):** Resisting a load (e.g., holding squat midpoint, plank).
- **Overcoming Isometrics (Pushing/Pulling):** Max effort against immovable object (e.g., pushing wall, pulling against fixed pins).

**Benefits:**
- **Strength Gains:** Increases strength, particularly at the trained joint angle (+/- ~15-20 degrees). Overcoming iso may enhance neural drive.
- **Tendon Health/Rehab:** Isometric loading can reduce pain/improve function in tendinopathies ([Rio et al., 2015]).
- **Muscle Activation/Mind-Muscle Connection.**
- **Joint Stability.**
- **Low Joint Stress:** Stimulus with minimal joint movement (useful in rehab).

**Implementation:** Hold durations 3-10s (strength/activation), 30-60s+ (endurance/tendon). Submaximal to maximal intensity. Can be standalone or integrated (e.g., iso holds in dynamic lifts).
