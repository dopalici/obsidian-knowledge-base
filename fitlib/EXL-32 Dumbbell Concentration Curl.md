### **EXL-32: Dumbbell Concentration Curl**

**ID:** EXL-32-DB-CONCENTRATIONCURL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A highly isolated bicep curl variation performed seated, with the back of the upper arm braced against the inner thigh. This minimizes momentum and maximizes focus on the biceps contraction.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Requires focus on strict form).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (strong peak contraction squeeze, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Standard Dumbbell Bicep Curl[[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]].
- Machine Bicep Curl [[EXL-60 Bicep Curl (Machine - Preacher or Seated)]].
- Cable Bicep Curl [[EXL-69 Cable Bicep Curl (BarHandles)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature (maintaining seated posture) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Muscles of non-working arm/leg bracing.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on edge of bench, feet flat on floor, legs spread moderately wide. Lean forward slightly. Hold dumbbell in one hand with underhand (supinated) grip. Brace the back of the upper arm (triceps area) firmly against the inner thigh of the same side. Let dumbbell hang straight down towards floor.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arm braced and stationary, exhale and curl dumbbell upwards towards shoulder. Focus entirely on contracting the biceps; avoid any body swing or shoulder involvement. Squeeze forcefully at the peak contraction. Inhale and slowly lower dumbbell back to the starting position under full control, achieving full elbow extension. Complete all reps for one arm before switching.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Lifting upper arm off thigh, using body momentum, incomplete range of motion (especially extension), swinging weight.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Emphasize very strict form. The bracing removes momentum, so lighter weights are typically needed compared to standing curls. Focus on the quality of contraction.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets with strict form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (strictness, peak contraction, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
