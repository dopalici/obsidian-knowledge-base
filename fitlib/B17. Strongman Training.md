### B17. Strongman Training
**ID:** B17-STRONGMAN
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Strongman training involves lifting heavy, awkwardly shaped objects and performing unique feats of strength, often combining maximal strength, power, muscular endurance, and cardiovascular conditioning.

**Common Events & Implements:** Atlas Stones, Log Press, Farmer's Walk, Yoke Carry, Tire Flip, Vehicle Pull, Axle Bar Lifts, Car Deadlift, Medleys.

**Training Principles:**
- **Maximal Strength Foundation:** High levels of basic strength ([[B4. Strength Training Principles]]) essential.
- **Implement Proficiency:** Specific practice with competition implements crucial.
- **Grip Strength:** Extremely demanding.
- **Core Strength & Stability:** Required for heavy, awkward loads ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- **Conditioning:** Events often require sustained effort, demanding high muscular/cardiovascular endurance ([[E1. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Training]]).
- **Mental Toughness.**

**Programming:** Combines heavy basic strength work, implement-specific training, conditioning. Requires specialized equipment.
