### **EXL-58: Chest Supported Row (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-58-MEX-ROW-CHESTSUP **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based row variation [[B10. Machine Training]] where the chest is supported against a pad, isolating the back muscles (lats, rhomboids, traps) by minimizing torso involvement and momentum. Various grip options are often available.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack/Plates) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Strong peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Grip Width/Type (Wide, Narrow, Neutral, Pronated, Supinated - alters muscle emphasis slightly).
- Progress to unsupported rows like Seated Cable Row [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]] , Dumbbell Rows [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]], or Barbell Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Focus on scapular retraction exercises.
- Resistance Band Rows [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff, Erector Spinae (minimal demand due to support).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so chest is firmly supported on pad when reaching for handles. Sit or position body as per machine design. Grasp handles with desired grip. Allow arms to extend fully, feeling a stretch in the back (scapular protraction).
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by retracting scapulae (pinch shoulder blades together). Exhale and pull handles towards torso, driving elbows back. Focus on squeezing mid-back muscles at peak contraction. Keep chest supported on pad. Pause briefly. Inhale and slowly return handles to starting position under control, allowing scapulae to protract.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Shrugging shoulders, using momentum by pushing off feet or moving torso, incomplete range of motion (especially scapular movement), pulling primarily with arms.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Generally very safe due to chest support.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat/pad adjustment. Control the weight throughout the movement. Focus on muscle contraction rather than just moving weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (scapular movement, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
