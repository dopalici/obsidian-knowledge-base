### L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training
**ID:** L1-MOVEMENT-PATTERNS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Functional training emphasizes training *movements*, not just isolated muscles, focusing on patterns that mimic activities of daily living (ADL) and sport-specific actions. It aims to improve movement quality, coordination, stability, and overall functional capacity.

**Fundamental Human Movement Patterns:** (Categorizations vary, common examples include)
1.  **Squat:** Dominant knee/hip flexion/extension in vertical plane. Examples: Bodyweight squat, goblet squat, barbell squat. Relates to sitting, standing, lifting low objects.
2.  **Hinge:** Dominant hip flexion/extension with minimal knee bend, maintaining neutral spine. Examples: Deadlift variations, kettlebell swing, good morning. Relates to picking objects off floor, jumping.
3.  **Lunge:** Stepping patterns involving single-leg stability and hip/knee flexion/extension. Examples: Forward, reverse, lateral lunges; step-ups. Relates to walking, running, climbing stairs.
4.  **Push:** Upper body pressing movements.
    - *Horizontal:* Push-ups, bench press.
    - *Vertical:* Overhead press, handstands. Relates to pushing objects, getting up from floor.
5.  **Pull:** Upper body pulling movements.
    - *Horizontal:* Rows (dumbbell, barbell, cable).
    - *Vertical:* Pull-ups, chin-ups, lat pulldowns. Relates to pulling objects, climbing.
6.  **Carry:** Locomotion while carrying external load. Examples: Farmer's walk, suitcase carry, overhead carry. Develops grip strength, core stability, work capacity. Relates to carrying groceries, luggage.
7.  **Rotate / Anti-Rotation:** Twisting movements or resisting rotational forces. Examples: Woodchops, medicine ball throws (rotation); Pallof press, single-arm carries (anti-rotation). Relates to throwing, swinging, stabilizing torso during asymmetrical movements. ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]).

**Principles of Functional Training:**
- **Multi-Joint & Multi-Planar:** Exercises often involve multiple joints working together across sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes ([[G-VII-2. Kinesiology Movement Analysis]]).
- **Integrated Stability & Mobility:** Requires coordinated control of joint movement (mobility - [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]) and joint stability (often core/hips/shoulders - [[L4. Core Stability Training]]).
- **Proprioceptive Rich:** Often involves free weights, bodyweight, or unstable surfaces (used judiciously - [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]) to enhance body awareness and neuromuscular control.
- **Transferability:** Aims to improve performance in ADL or specific sports by training relevant movement patterns and capacities.
- **Movement Quality Focus:** Emphasis on proper technique and control over simply lifting heavy weight ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]). Movement screening often used to identify starting points ([[A17. Movement Screening]]).

**Implementation:** Programs often built around these fundamental patterns, progressing from simple bodyweight variations to more complex loaded or dynamic versions.
