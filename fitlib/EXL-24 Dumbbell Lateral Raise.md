### **EXL-24: Dumbbell Lateral Raise**

**ID:** EXL-24-DB-LATRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise involving raising dumbbells out to the sides, primarily targeting the medial (side) head of the deltoid muscle to increase shoulder width and roundness.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses at top, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cable Lateral Raises [[EXL-71 Cable Lateral Raise]].
- Machine Lateral Raises [[EXL-53 Lateral Raise (Machine)]].
- Leaning Lateral Raises (alters resistance curve).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Lateral Raises [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on scapular plane raises (slightly forward angle, often more comfortable).
- Start with lighter weights focusing strictly on form.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Medial Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Posterior Deltoid, Supraspinatus (initiates abduction), Trapezius (Upper - assists in final ROM/upward rotation).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff, Muscles controlling scapula.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand or sit upright with core engaged, holding dumbbells at sides with palms facing body (neutral grip) or slightly towards back. Maintain slight bend in elbows throughout movement. Keep chest up and shoulders down (avoid shrugging initially).
- **Execution:** Raise dumbbells out to the sides, leading with the elbows, until arms are approximately parallel to the floor (or slightly higher/lower based on comfort). Maintain slight elbow bend. Imagine pushing hands outwards, not just upwards. Avoid excessive momentum or swinging. Control the descent (eccentric phase) slowly back to the starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during the raise (concentric), inhale during the lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum/body swing, shrugging shoulders up (using upper traps excessively), bending elbows too much (turning it into a row/curl), raising dumbbells too far forward (engaging anterior deltoid more), insufficient range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). May aggravate impingement if performed incorrectly (e.g., internal rotation at top - "empty can" position sometimes discouraged). Consider raising in scapular plane (30 degrees forward) for comfort.
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight that allows strict form; momentum negates the purpose. Control the eccentric phase. Avoid locking elbows.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load with strict form.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, leading with elbows, controlling descent) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
