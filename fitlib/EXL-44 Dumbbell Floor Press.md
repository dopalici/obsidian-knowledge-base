### **EXL-44: Dumbbell Floor Press**

**ID:** EXL-44-DB-FLOORPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A bench press variation performed lying on the floor with dumbbells. The limited range of motion (upper arms stop at floor) reduces shoulder stress and emphasizes lockout strength, similar to the barbell version [[EXL-12 Barbell Floor Press]], but with independent dumbbell control.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Alternating Dumbbell Floor Press.
- Single-Arm Dumbbell Floor Press.
- Progress to full range Dumbbell Bench Press [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Push-ups (various regressions) [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Machine Chest Press [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Barbell Floor Press [[EXL-12 Barbell Floor Press]] (more stable).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii, Pectoralis Major (mid/lower range emphasized less due to ROM), Anterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Medial Deltoid, Serratus Anterior.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Glutes (if bridged).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie flat on floor, knees bent, feet flat. Hold dumbbells at chest level with neutral or pronated grip. Upper arms resting on floor, elbows bent (~45-75 degrees tuck).
- **Execution:** Brace core. Exhale and press dumbbells vertically upwards until arms are fully extended (avoid forceful lockout). Focus on triceps and chest contraction. Keep shoulders stable against floor. Inhale and lower dumbbells under control until upper arms lightly touch floor.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during press (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Flaring elbows excessively, unstable shoulders, uncontrolled descent, incomplete lockout.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or shoulder injuries. May be better tolerated than full ROM pressing for some shoulder issues due to reduced stretch.
- **Safety:** Control the weight throughout. Easiest to get into position by starting with dumbbells resting on floor near shoulders and rolling into position, or having someone hand them to you.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (control, elbow position, lockout) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
