### I1. Training and Hormonal Responses
**ID:** I1-HORMONAL-RESPONSES
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Exercise acts as a physiological stressor that elicits both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term adaptive) hormonal responses. These responses mediate many of the metabolic and structural adaptations to training. (Expands on [[A10. Hormonal Responses to Exercise]]).

**Acute Hormonal Responses (During/Post-Exercise):**
- **Catabolic Hormones (Fuel Mobilization & Stress Response):**
    - *Catecholamines (Epinephrine/Norepinephrine):* Increase rapidly with intensity/duration. Stimulate glycogenolysis, lipolysis, increase HR, BP, contractility.
    - *Cortisol:* Increases with moderate-to-high intensity (>60% VO2max) or prolonged duration (>60-90 min). Stimulates gluconeogenesis, protein breakdown (in periphery), fat mobilization; has anti-inflammatory effects acutely but immunosuppressive/catabolic effects if chronically elevated.
    - *Glucagon:* Increases to counteract insulin's effects and stimulate hepatic glucose production, maintaining blood glucose.
- **Anabolic/Growth-Related Hormones:**
    - *Growth Hormone (GH):* Pulsatile release increases, especially with high volume resistance training (metabolic stress) or moderate-intensity endurance exercise. Stimulates lipolysis, promotes protein synthesis indirectly via IGF-1.
    - *Testosterone:* May increase transiently, particularly with heavy resistance training (large muscle mass, moderate-high intensity/volume), though response variable. Anabolic effects. Response blunted by excessive volume/duration or low energy availability.
    - *Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1):* Mediates many GH effects, involved in muscle growth/repair. Can increase post-exercise.
- **Other Hormones:**
    - *Insulin:* Levels typically decrease during exercise (inhibited by catecholamines) to allow fuel mobilization. Sensitivity increases post-exercise.
    - *Endorphins:* Increase, contributing to analgesia and mood effects.

**Chronic Adaptations (Training Effects):**
- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Hallmark adaptation of regular exercise (both aerobic and resistance). Enhanced glucose uptake by muscles with less insulin required.
- **Altered Basal Levels:** Generally minor changes in resting levels of most hormones with moderate training. However, chronic high-volume/intensity training, especially combined with low energy availability ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]), can lead to:
    - *Suppressed Anabolic Hormones:* Lower resting testosterone (males), menstrual dysfunction/low estrogen (females - part of RED-S).
    - *Elevated Resting Cortisol:* Indicative of chronic stress/inadequate recovery.
- **Attenuated Response to Exercise:** Trained individuals often exhibit blunted catecholamine and cortisol responses to the *same absolute* exercise workload, reflecting improved physiological efficiency and stress tolerance. Response to the *same relative* intensity may be similar or slightly attenuated.

**Factors Influencing Hormonal Response:** Exercise intensity, duration, type, volume, muscle mass recruited, training status, nutritional status (energy availability, macro intake), sleep, stress levels, age, sex.
