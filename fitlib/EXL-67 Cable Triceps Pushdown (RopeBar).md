### **EXL-67: Cable Triceps Pushdown (Rope/Bar)**

**ID:** EXL-67-CEX-TRIPUSHDOWN _(Note: This is the same exercise as EXL-12 from the list, consolidating)_ **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a high pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the triceps brachii muscle through elbow extension. Various attachments (rope, straight bar, V-bar) can be used, offering slightly different feel and emphasis.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at full extension, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Attachment Variations (Rope allows more outward rotation at bottom, potentially better peak contraction; Bar allows heavier load).
- Single-Arm Pushdowns.
- Progress to free weight exercises like Close-Grip Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]], Dips [[EXL-82 Dip (Parallel Bar)]], Overhead Extensions [[EXL-35 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)]], Skullcrushers [[EXL-13 Barbell Skullcrusher (Lying Triceps Extension)]].
- Cable Overhead Triceps Extension [[EXL-68 Cable Overhead Triceps Extension (RopeBar)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Pushdowns [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Bench Dips (Bodyweight assistance) [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Machine Triceps Extension [[EXL-59 Triceps Extension (Machine - Overhead or Pushdown type)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (all three heads: long, lateral, medial).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers, Latissimus Dorsi (helps keep elbows tucked).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand facing a high cable pulley with desired attachment (e.g., rope, straight bar). Grasp attachment with overhand (bar) or neutral (rope) grip. Keep feet shoulder-width apart, slight bend in knees, core engaged. Maintain upright posture or slight forward lean from hips. Pull attachment down so elbows are bent at approximately 90 degrees and tucked close to sides. Keep shoulders down and back.
- **Execution:** Exhale and extend elbows fully, pressing the attachment straight down. Focus on contracting the triceps. Keep upper arms stationary throughout the movement (elbows act as hinge). Pause briefly at full extension, squeezing triceps (if using rope, can separate hands slightly at bottom). Inhale and slowly return the attachment to the starting position under control (eccentric phase).
- **Breathing:** Exhale during elbow extension (concentric), inhale during elbow flexion (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/leaning forward excessively, allowing elbows to flare out or move forward/backward, incomplete range of motion, shrugging shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow pain or injury (e.g., tendinopathy). Ensure proper form to avoid wrist strain depending on attachment.
- **Safety:** Maintain stable body position. Control the weight throughout the movement. Avoid using excessive weight that forces poor form or momentum.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, full ROM, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
