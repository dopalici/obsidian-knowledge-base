*(Content based on FZC-1.4)*
The Principle of Reversibility highlights that fitness adaptations are transient and will gradually be lost if the training stimulus is stopped or significantly reduced ("Use it or lose it"). Cardiovascular fitness declines faster than strength. Consistency and maintenance training are important.

**Rate of Loss:**
- **Cardio:** Significant drops in VO2max, plasma volume, SV within 2-4 weeks.
- **Strength:** Slower decline; neural factors first, atrophy later. Maintainable with reduced frequency/volume if intensity kept high.
- **Flexibility:** Lost relatively quickly without practice.

**Implications:** Need for consistent training or planned maintenance programs during breaks. Fitness can be regained (often faster due to "muscle memory").
