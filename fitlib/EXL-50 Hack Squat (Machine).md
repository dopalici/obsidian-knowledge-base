### **EXL-50: Hack Squat (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-50-MEX-HACKSQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based squat variation [[B10. Machine Training]] where the lifter stands on an angled platform and pushes against shoulder pads attached to a sled moving on rails. Typically emphasizes the quadriceps more than traditional squats due to the fixed path and back support.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Plates) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], pauses).
- Vary Foot Placement (similar to Leg Press: higher = more glute/ham; lower = more quad; wider = more adductor/glute; narrower = more outer quad).
- Increase Depth (while maintaining good form).
- Progress to Free Weight Squats [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]] / [[EXL-08 Barbell Front Squat]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Leg Press [[EXL-46 Leg Press (Machine)]] (often allows stricter back support).
- Bodyweight Squats [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] or Goblet Squats [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]].
- Leg Extensions [[EXL-47 Leg Extension (Machine)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps (often emphasized), Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings, Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (less demand than free squats but still needed), Calves.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Position shoulders firmly under pads, back flat against backrest. Place feet on platform roughly shoulder-width apart (adjust as needed). Ensure lower back remains in contact with pad. Grip handles for stability. Release safety mechanism.
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower the sled under control by bending hips and knees. Descend to a depth where thighs are at least parallel to the platform, or as deep as possible while maintaining good form (back flat against pad). Drive through the heels and mid-foot to press the sled back up, extending hips and knees. Avoid locking out knees completely at the top. Exhale during ascent.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Lower back lifting off pad ("butt wink"), insufficient depth, knees caving inward (valgus), locking out knees forcefully, foot placement too high/low causing stress.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries, certain low back conditions (requires maintaining neutral spine against pad). Can be stressful on knees for some individuals.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper setup and understand safety levers. Maintain contact between back/hips and pad throughout. Control the movement; avoid bouncing out of the bottom. Use appropriate weight allowing good form.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (depth, back position, knee tracking) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
