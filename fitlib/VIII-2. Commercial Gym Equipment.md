    - Higher impact compared to other options
    - Proper use involves avoiding excessive handrail support
- **Ellipticals:**
    - Low-impact, full-body movement
    - Simulates running/stair climbing
    - Adjustable resistance and incline
    - Fixed stride path may not suit all users
- **Stationary Bikes:**
    - **Upright:** Mimics road bike posture
    - **Recumbent:** Seated with back support, less glute/hamstring engagement
    - **Spin Bikes:** Allows standing, high-intensity workouts
    - Low-impact, suitable for various fitness levels
- **Rowing Ergometers (Ergs):**

    - Emphasizes legs, back, and core
    - Requires proper technique
    - Excellent cardiovascular and muscular endurance stimulus
- **Stair Climbers / Stepmills:**
    - Simulate stair climbing
    - High-intensity lower body workout
    - Targets endurance and strength
- **Arc Trainers / Adaptive Motion Trainers:**
    - Variable stride paths and resistance patterns
    - Lower impact alternative to traditional cardio machines

**Resistance Machines:**

- **Selectorized Machines:**
    - Use weight stack with pin
    - Easy weight adjustment
    - Guided movement path
    - Ideal for beginners and muscle isolation
- **Plate-Loaded Machines:**
    - Use standard weight plates
    - Allow heavier loads
    - Slightly less constrained movement paths
    - Common for leg press, hack squat, chest press, rows
- **Cable Machines / Functional Trainers:**
    - Use pulleys and cables
    - Provide constant tension
    - Highly versatile for multi-planar movements
    - Allow isolation and complex movement patterns

**Free Weights Area:**

- Barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells
