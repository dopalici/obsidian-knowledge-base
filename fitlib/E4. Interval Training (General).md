### E4. Interval Training (General)

Interval training is a broad category of training that involves alternating periods of higher intensity exercise with periods of lower intensity exercise or rest. HIIT ([[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]]) is a specific type of interval training.

**Purpose:** Allows individuals to perform greater amounts of high-intensity work than would be possible with continuous exercise at the same intensity. Provides targeted stimulus for specific energy systems and physiological adaptations.

**Variables to Manipulate:**
- **Work Interval Intensity:** Can range from moderate (e.g., threshold pace - [[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]) to maximal (e.g., sprint pace). Determines primary physiological stress.
- **Work Interval Duration:** Can range from very short (<10s) to long (>5-10 min). Influences energy system contribution.
- **Recovery Interval Intensity:** Can be passive (rest) or active (low intensity). Active recovery may aid lactate clearance but adds overall stress.
- **Recovery Interval Duration:** Determines degree of recovery between work bouts. Affects ability to maintain intensity and influences cumulative stress. Work:Rest ratio is key variable.
- **Number of Repetitions/Intervals:** Determines total volume of high-intensity work.
- **Number of Sets:** Grouping intervals into sets with longer rest between sets.

**Benefits:** Highly versatile for targeting specific adaptations (e.g., VO2max, lactate threshold, anaerobic capacity, speed endurance) depending on how variables are manipulated. More engaging than steady-state for some individuals.

**Examples (Non-HIIT):**
- **Threshold Intervals:** Longer intervals (e.g., 5-15 min) performed at or near lactate threshold (LT2) intensity, with shorter recovery periods (e.g., 1:1 or 2:1 work:rest). Aim to improve LT.
- **VO2 Max Intervals:** Intervals (e.g., 2-5 min) performed at intensity close to VO2max (~90-100% vVO2max or HRmax), with recovery periods often similar in duration (e.g., 1:1 work:rest). Aim to improve VO2max ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]).
