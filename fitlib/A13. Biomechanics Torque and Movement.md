Torque (or Moment of Force) is the rotational effect of a force. It causes or tends to cause rotation around an axis (joint). Torque \= Force x Moment Arm.

\- \*\*Moment Arm (Lever Arm):\*\* The perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation (joint center) to the line of action of the force.  
\- \*\*Muscle Torque:\*\* Force generated by muscle x its moment arm relative to the joint center. This torque creates movement.  
\- \*\*Resistance Torque:\*\* Force of resistance (gravity, external load) x its moment arm relative to the joint center. This torque opposes movement.  
\- \*\*Net Torque:\*\* The sum of all torques acting around a joint. Determines the direction and acceleration of angular motion. If muscle torque \> resistance torque, concentric contraction occurs; if resistance torque \> muscle torque, eccentric contraction occurs; if torques are equal, isometric contraction occurs.  
\- \*\*Changing Moment Arms:\*\* Both muscle and resistance moment arms change throughout a joint's range of motion, altering the torque required and produced at different joint angles. This explains why exercises feel harder/easier at different points.

\*\*Implications:\*\* Torque dictates the rotational demands on muscles and joints during exercise. Understanding how moment arms change helps explain strength curves and allows for exercise modification to target specific points in the ROM or alter difficulty.
