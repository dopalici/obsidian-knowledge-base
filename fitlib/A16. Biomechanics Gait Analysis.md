Gait analysis is the systematic study of human locomotion (walking and running). It involves observing and measuring body movements, mechanics, and muscle activity during the gait cycle.

\*\*Gait Cycle Phases:\*\*  
\- \*\*Stance Phase (\~60% walking):\*\* Foot in contact with ground. Sub-phases: Heel Strike (Initial Contact), Foot Flat (Loading Response), Midstance, Heel Off (Terminal Stance), Toe Off (Pre-Swing).  
\- \*\*Swing Phase (\~40% walking):\*\* Foot not in contact with ground. Sub-phases: Initial Swing, Mid-Swing, Terminal Swing.  
\- \*Running gait has shorter stance phase, longer swing phase, and includes a flight phase (both feet off ground).\*

\*\*Analysis Methods:\*\*  
\- \*\*Observational Gait Analysis (OGA):\*\* Visual assessment of movement patterns from different views (sagittal, frontal, transverse). Identifies gross deviations.  
\- \*\*Video Analysis:\*\* Slow-motion review for detailed assessment.  
\- \*\*Kinematic Analysis:\*\* Measurement of joint angles, segment positions, velocities, accelerations (using motion capture systems).  
\- \*\*Kinetic Analysis:\*\* Measurement of forces involved (using force plates for ground reaction forces, calculating joint moments/torques).  
\- \*\*Electromyography (EMG):\*\* Measurement of muscle electrical activity patterns.

\*\*Common Gait Deviations:\*\* Excessive pronation/supination, hip drop (Trendelenburg gait), circumduction, knee valgus/varus, inadequate push-off, overstriding (running).

\*\*Implications:\*\* Gait analysis helps identify movement inefficiencies, potential causes of lower limb injury (though link is complex), and guides interventions (exercise prescription, footwear recommendations, orthotics). Crucial for running assessment (\[\[X1-RUNNING\]\]).
