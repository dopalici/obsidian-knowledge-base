### **EXL-84: Plank (Standard & Variations)**

**ID:** EXL-84-BW-PLANK _(Note: This duplicates EXL-25 from the list, consolidating variations)_ **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An isometric core stability exercise [[B19. Isometrics]] involving holding a rigid, straight line from head to heels, typically supported on forearms/hands and toes. Primarily targets the anterior core muscles [[L4. Core Stability Training]] and emphasizes resisting spinal extension.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (depending on variation and duration).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Hold Duration [[B19. Isometrics]].
- Add Instability (e.g., on stability ball, TRX [[B12. Suspension Training (TRX)]]).
- Limb Movement (e.g., alternating arm/leg raises, plank taps, plank jacks).
- Add External Load (e.g., weight plate on back).
- Side Plank [[EXL-85 Side Plank (Standard & Variations)]].
- RKC Plank (maximal full-body tension).
- Long Lever Plank (elbows further forward).
- Body Saw (using sliders or stability ball).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Knee Plank (support on knees instead of toes).
- Incline Plank (hands/forearms on elevated surface).
- Shorter Hold Durations.
- Focus on Dead Bug or Bird Dog exercises [[L4. Core Stability Training]].
- Hollow Body Hold [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Stabilizers:** Rectus Abdominis, Transverse Abdominis, Obliques (Internal & External), Erector Spinae.
- **Secondary Stabilizers:** Glutes, Quadriceps, Serratus Anterior, Pectoralis Major, Latissimus Dorsi, Shoulders (Deltoids, Rotator Cuff).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Forearm Plank):** Lie prone, place forearms on floor with elbows directly under shoulders, palms flat or clasped. Place toes on floor, feet hip-width apart.
- **Setup (High Plank):** Hands directly under shoulders, arms straight (like top of push-up [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]]).
- **Execution:** Lift hips off floor, creating a straight line from head to heels. Engage core by bracing abdominals (imagine pulling belly button towards spine or resisting a punch) and squeezing glutes. Avoid letting hips sag too low (lumbar hyperextension) or rise too high (piking). Keep head/neck in line with spine (look down or slightly forward). Hold the position isometrically, breathing steadily.
- **Breathing:** Maintain steady, controlled breathing throughout the hold. Do not hold breath excessively (avoid Valsalva for extended holds).
- **Common Faults:** Hips sagging, hips too high, head dropping or looking up, holding breath, shoulders creeping towards ears.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back pain (may need modification), shoulder injuries (pain with weight-bearing), pregnancy (modify/avoid traditional plank, especially later stages [[G1. Exercise During Pregnancy]]). Diastasis recti may require specific modifications.
- **Safety:** Focus on quality of contraction and maintaining neutral spine over hold duration. Stop if form breaks down significantly or pain occurs.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max hold time with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Ability to maintain form during variations (e.g., limb raises).
- Qualitative assessment of spinal position and core engagement [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
