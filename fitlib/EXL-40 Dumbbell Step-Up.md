### **EXL-40: Dumbbell Step-Up**

**ID:** EXL-40-DB-STEPUP **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A unilateral lower-body exercise involving stepping up onto an elevated surface (box or bench) while holding dumbbells, then stepping back down. Primarily targets the quadriceps and glutes of the stepping leg, also improves balance and stability.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Box/Bench Height (increases ROM and difficulty).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric lowering, Pause at top).
- Add Knee Drive at top (increases glute/hip flexor involvement).
- Barbell Step-Up [[B8. Free Weights (Barbells, Dumbbells)]].
- Progress to Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]] or Split Squats [[EXL-38 Dumbbell Split Squat]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Bodyweight [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Lower Box/Bench Height.
- Use hands lightly for balance support initially.
- Focus on improving balance [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]].
- Perform Reverse Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]]
**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps (stepping leg), Gluteus Maximus (stepping leg).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings (stepping leg), Adductor Magnus, Gluteus Medius/Minimus (hip stability), Soleus/Gastrocnemius.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Muscles of the foot and ankle.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand facing a sturdy box or bench of appropriate height (start lower, e.g., knee height or below). Hold dumbbells at sides. Place one foot fully onto the center of the box/bench.
- **Execution:** Lean slightly forward, brace core. Drive through the heel of the front (elevated) foot to step up onto the box, bringing the trailing foot up to meet it. Minimize pushing off excessively with the back (floor) foot â€“ focus on the front leg doing the work. Stand tall briefly at the top. Step back down slowly and under control with the trailing foot first, followed by the lead foot. Complete all reps on one side before switching, or alternate legs.
- **Breathing:** Exhale while stepping up (concentric), inhale while stepping down (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pushing off excessively with the floor leg, using momentum, front knee collapsing inward (valgus), poor balance, uncontrolled descent (slamming foot down).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries. Significant balance issues require caution or starting with regressions. Ensure box/bench height is appropriate to avoid excessive hip flexion or knee stress.
- **Safety:** Ensure box/bench is stable and won't tip or slide. Place entire leading foot firmly on the surface. Control the movement, especially the descent. Start with lower height and bodyweight to master form.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Box height used.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal push-off from floor leg, balance, control, knee tracking) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
