### **EXL-90: Russian Twist (Bodyweight or Weighted)**

**ID:** EXL-90-BW-RUSSITWIST **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A core exercise targeting the obliques and rectus abdominis through trunk rotation. Performed seated on the floor, often leaning back with feet elevated or anchored, involving twisting the torso from side to side, sometimes holding a weight.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (feet down) to Intermediate (feet up/weighted).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (Hold dumbbell, weight plate, medicine ball) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Lift Feet Off Floor (increases instability and core demand).
- Increase Speed of Rotation (use caution).
- Cable Woodchops [[EXL-76 Cable Woodchop (High-to-Low  Low-to-High)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Perform with Feet Anchored on Floor.
- Decrease Range of Motion (less twist).
- Use Bodyweight only [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Perform standing torso twists with band/cable (less lower back stress).
- Side Planks [[EXL-85 Side Plank (Standard & Variations)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Obliques (Internal and External), Rectus Abdominis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hip Flexors (isometric hold), Serratus Anterior.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Transverse Abdominis, Glutes. [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on floor, knees bent, feet flat on floor (easier) or lifted slightly off floor (harder). Lean back slightly, maintaining straight back (avoid rounding), engaging core. Clasp hands together in front of chest or hold weight.
- **Execution:** Rotate torso from side to side in a controlled manner, touching hands or weight lightly to the floor on each side (optional). Movement should come primarily from twisting the torso/shoulders, not just moving arms. Keep core braced.
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you twist to one side, inhale as you return to center or twist to other side. Maintain steady rhythm.
- **Common Faults:** Rounding the lower back, moving primarily arms instead of torso, using excessive momentum, insufficient range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back pain (especially disc issues or rotation sensitivity). Requires careful execution to avoid straining lower back.
- **Safety:** Maintain neutral spine (avoid rounding). Control the rotation. Start with bodyweight and feet down. Progress gradually. If back pain occurs, choose anti-rotation exercises like [[EXL-77 Cable Pallof Press (Anti-Rotation)]] instead.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Reps performed (bodyweight or weighted) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load used (if weighted).
- Qualitative assessment of form (torso rotation, spinal posture, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
