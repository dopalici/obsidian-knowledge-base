### A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals
**ID:** A8-CARDIO-PHYSIOLOGY
**Created:** 2025-04-23

The cardiovascular system (heart, blood vessels, blood) delivers oxygen/nutrients and removes waste, adapting significantly to exercise.

**Key Components & Functions:** Heart (pump), Blood Vessels (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins), Blood (plasma, RBCs, WBCs, platelets).

**Key Hemodynamic Variables:**
- **Heart Rate (HR):** Beats/min. Increases linearly with intensity up to HRmax.
- **Stroke Volume (SV):** Volume/beat. Increases with intensity up to ~40-60% VO2max, then plateaus (untrained). Influenced by preload, afterload, contractility.
- **Cardiac Output (Q):** Q = HR x SV. Total blood pumped/min. Increases linearly with intensity. Key determinant of [[E11. VO2 Max Training]].
- **Blood Pressure (BP):** Systolic/Diastolic. Systolic increases with exercise; Diastolic stable/slight decrease (aerobic). Larger transient increases with resistance exercise.
- **Arteriovenous O2 Difference (a-vO2 diff):** O2 extraction by tissues. Increases during exercise.

**Adaptations to Endurance Training:** ↓ Resting HR, ↑ Resting/Maximal SV, ↑ Maximal Q, ↑ Blood Volume, ↑ Capillary density, ↑ Mitochondrial density. (Related to [[E1. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Training]]).
