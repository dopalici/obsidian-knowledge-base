Sprinting represents the maximal velocity locomotion achievable by humans over short distances, typically ranging from dashes (<60m) to events up to 400m in track and field, and forming a critical component of performance in numerous team and individual sports. It is a complex skill demanding an extraordinary integration of neuromuscular power, metabolic capacity (primarily anaerobic), refined technique across distinct phases, and specific physical preparation.

**Physiological Demands (Highly Specific & Intense):**
- **Energy Systems ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]):** Sprinting is fundamentally anaerobic, relying heavily on immediate high-energy phosphates and rapid glycolysis.
    - *ATP-PCr System:* Dominant energy source for the initial ~5-8 seconds, crucial for overcoming inertia during acceleration and achieving peak power output. Capacity limited by intramuscular PCr stores. Creatine supplementation directly targets enhancing this system ([[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]).
    - *Glycolytic System:* Becomes increasingly important after the initial seconds, especially in sprints lasting >10-15 seconds up to ~60 seconds (e.g., 200m-400m). Provides rapid ATP regeneration but leads to significant accumulation of metabolites (H+, Pi, lactate), contributing to fatigue and acidosis. Training enhances glycolytic enzyme activity and buffering capacity.
    - *Oxidative System:* Minimal direct contribution to ATP production *during* maximal sprints (<60s), but absolutely critical for PCr resynthesis and lactate clearance *between* sprints/reps and during overall recovery, thus underpinning repeated sprint ability (RSA).
- **Neuromuscular Factors ([[G-VII-3. Neurophysiology of Movement]]):** Achieving maximal speed requires exceptional neural drive and coordination.
    - *Motor Unit Recruitment:* Maximal recruitment of high-threshold motor units, particularly those innervating Type IIx and IIa muscle fibers ([[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]]), is essential for high force/power output.
    - *Rate Coding:* High firing frequencies of motor neurons are needed to achieve maximal force production and RFD.
    - *Synchronization:* Coordinated firing of motor units enhances net force output.
    - *Intermuscular Coordination:* Precise timing and activation patterns between agonist, antagonist, and synergist muscles (e.g., coordinated hip/knee flexor/extensor action).
    - *Stretch-Shortening Cycle (SSC):* Efficient utilization of the SSC (rapid eccentric loading followed by immediate concentric contraction) in leg muscles during ground contact is critical for generating high forces rapidly and minimizing ground contact time, especially during maximum velocity phase. Involves elastic energy storage/recoil in tendons and potentiation via stretch reflex.
- **Power & Rate of Force Development (RFD):** The ability to produce high forces *quickly* is paramount, particularly during acceleration where ground contact times are longer and large horizontal forces are needed, and during maximum velocity where ground contact times are extremely short (<0.1s) requiring rapid force application. RFD is highly dependent on neural factors and Type II fiber characteristics. Force-Velocity profiling can identify individual deficits in force vs. velocity production ([Morin & Samozino, 2016]).

**Biomechanical Considerations & Technique Phases:**
- **Start & Acceleration Phase (~0-30m):**
    - *Goal:* Maximize horizontal velocity gain by overcoming inertia. Requires high net horizontal ground reaction force (GRF).
    - *Technique:* Deep forward body lean projecting COG ahead of support foot; powerful, piston-like leg drive extending hip, knee, ankle ("triple extension") pushing backward against ground; low heel recovery; forceful, coordinated arm swing; gradually increasing stride length and decreasing ground contact time as velocity increases; transition to more upright posture progressively. Common faults: insufficient lean, premature upright posture, ineffective arm action, casting legs out instead of driving back.
- **Maximum Velocity Phase (~30-80m, varies):**
    - *Goal:* Achieve and maintain highest possible speed. Focus shifts from horizontal force production to effective vertical force application to counteract gravity and recycle energy via SSC.
    - *Technique:* Near-upright posture (slight forward lean); cyclical leg action involving rapid hip flexion ("knee up"), thigh moving towards parallel with ground, followed by forceful downward/backward "pawing" action of foot landing close to under COG; minimized ground contact time (<0.1s); high stride frequency (cadence); stiff ankle complex upon contact; relaxed upper body with coordinated arm swing. Common faults: overstriding (landing foot too far ahead of COG, causing braking forces), excessive tension, poor pelvic control, inadequate knee lift.
- **Speed Endurance / Deceleration Phase (>60-100m):**
    - *Goal:* Minimize inevitable deceleration due to neuromuscular fatigue, metabolic byproduct accumulation, and potential technique breakdown.
    - *Technique:* Maintaining form becomes critical. Focus on maintaining cyclical action, front-side mechanics (high knee lift), relaxation, and efficient arm swing despite fatigue. Ability to buffer metabolites and maintain neural drive crucial. Requires specific training stimulus.

**Training Components:**
- **Technique Drills:** Essential at all phases. Drills focusing on start mechanics (block work), acceleration posture/drive (wall drills, sled pushes), max velocity mechanics (A-skips, B-skips, straight leg bounds, wicket drills emphasizing cyclical action and ground contact). Video analysis highly beneficial.
- **Acceleration Development:** Short sprints (10-40m) with full recovery from various starts (blocks, standing, rolling). Resisted sprints (sleds - ~10-20% bodyweight optimal for technique, heavier loads for strength; hills; bands) overload horizontal force production phase. Focus on powerful projection.
- **Maximum Velocity Development:** Sprints targeting top speed zone (e.g., 30-80m), often using flying starts (build-up run before timed segment) to ensure maximal speed is reached within the measured distance. Full recovery essential (~1 min per 10m sprinted guideline). Assisted sprints (slight downhill <3 degrees, towing systems) aim to increase stride frequency/neuromuscular adaptations (use judiciously, potential technique disruption/injury risk).
- **Speed Endurance Training:** Improves ability to maintain speed under fatigue.
    - *Short Speed Endurance:* Longer sprints (e.g., 150m-300m) at high intensity (90-95%+) with long recovery.
    - *Intensive Tempo / Lactate Tolerance:* Repeated sprints (e.g., 6-10 x 200m) with incomplete recovery (e.g., 2-3 min), generating high lactate levels and improving buffering capacity.
    - *Extensive Tempo:* Longer intervals (e.g., 300m-600m) at lower intensity (~70-80%) with shorter recovery, improving aerobic contribution to recovery and specific endurance.
- **Strength Training ([[B4. Strength Training Principles]], [[X1.1. Strength Training for Runners]]):** Foundational for force production. Heavy compound lifts (squats, deadlifts/RDLs, hip thrusts, lunges, step-ups) targeting key muscles (glutes, hamstrings, quads). Upper body/core work for posture and force transfer ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]). Emphasis on relative strength and power transfer. Periodized approach essential.
- **Power Training ([[B13. Strength Training Goals (Max Strength, Power, Hypertrophy, Endurance)]]):** Crucial for RFD and SSC efficiency.
    - *Plyometrics:* Jumps (box jumps, broad jumps), bounds (horizontal/vertical), hops (single leg). Focus on minimizing ground contact time and explosive power. Requires strength base. Progress volume/intensity carefully.
    - *Olympic Weightlifting Variations:* Snatches, cleans, jerks and their derivatives (power versions, pulls) develop triple extension power and high RFD ([[B15. Olympic Weightlifting]]). Require technical coaching.
    - *Medicine Ball Throws:* Develop rotational and upper body power.
- **Mobility & Flexibility ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]):** Essential for achieving optimal positions and fluid movement, particularly hip flexors, hamstrings, glutes, ankles, thoracic spine. Dynamic mobility in warm-ups, static stretching post-training or separate sessions.

**Nutrition & Recovery Considerations:**
- **Fueling:** Ensure high carbohydrate availability to fuel high-intensity sessions and replenish glycogen ([[A3. Macronutrients]]). Nutrient timing around training may be beneficial ([[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]]).
- **Supplements:** Creatine monohydrate strongly recommended (3-5g/day) to enhance ATP-PCr system capacity and performance ([[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]). Beta-alanine may benefit longer sprints (200-400m). Caffeine can reduce RPE/enhance performance.
- **Recovery ([[M. Recovery Strategies]]):** Sprinting is highly demanding on CNS and musculoskeletal system. Prioritize sleep ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]), adequate protein ([[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]), manage overall stress ([[M3. Stress Management and Performance]]). Active recovery/modalities may aid perceived recovery.

**Common Injuries ([[IX-1. Common Musculoskeletal Injuries]]):** Hamstring strains are the most prevalent acute injury, often occurring during late swing phase (eccentric loading) or maximal velocity phase. Hip flexor strains, adductor strains, quadriceps strains, Achilles issues, and stress fractures can also occur. Risk factors include inadequate warm-up, poor mechanics, muscle imbalances (e.g., quad:hamstring ratio), insufficient strength/mobility, fatigue, training load errors ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]).
