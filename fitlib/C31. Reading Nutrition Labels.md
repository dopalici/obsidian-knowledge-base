**ID:** C31-READING-LABELS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Effectively reading and interpreting nutrition labels on packaged foods empowers consumers to make informed choices aligned with their health and fitness goals [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]]. Label regulations differ globally (e.g., FDA in the US, EFSA in the EU), but core components are often similar.

**Key Components to Understand (Using US FDA Label as Example):**

1. **Serving Information:**
    - **Serving Size:** Standardized amount used for nutrient calculation (e.g., 1 cup, 2 cookies). **Crucial:** Compare your actual portion to this size.
    - **Servings Per Container:** Total number of servings in the package. Multiply nutrient values by servings consumed if eating more than one serving.
2. **Calories:** Energy per serving. "Calories from Fat" is often no longer required, as type of fat is more important.
3. **Nutrients (% Daily Value - %DV):**
    - **Nutrients to Limit:** Saturated Fat, Trans Fat (aim for 0g), Sodium, Added Sugars. High %DV (≥20%) indicates high content per serving.
    - **Nutrients to Get Enough Of:** Dietary Fiber, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Potassium. High %DV (≥20%) indicates a good source.
    - **%DV Explained:** Based on a general 2000-calorie diet for adults. Use as a quick guide: 5% DV or less is low, 20% DV or more is high. Individual needs may vary significantly based on TDEE [[A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)]] and goals [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]].
4. **Macronutrient Details:**
    - Total Fat (includes Saturated, Trans, Polyunsaturated, Monounsaturated)
    - Total Carbohydrate (includes Dietary Fiber, Total Sugars - with **Added Sugars** listed separately) [[A3. Macronutrients]]. Aim to limit Added Sugars.
    - Protein
5. **Micronutrients:** Mandatory listing of Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Potassium reflects common public health concerns. Other vitamins/minerals may be listed voluntarily [[A4. Micronutrients]].
6. **Ingredient List:**
    - **Order:** Ingredients listed by weight in descending order. The first few ingredients compose the largest part of the food.
    - **Identify:** Look for whole food ingredients vs. refined grains, multiple sources of added sugars (e.g., sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, dextrose, maltose), types of fats (e.g., hydrogenated oils = trans fat), sodium sources, and additives.
    - **Length:** Shorter lists often indicate less processing [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].

**Using Labels Effectively:**

- Compare similar products based on serving size, calories, key nutrients (e.g., added sugar, fiber, sodium, saturated fat), and ingredients.
- Use for tracking macronutrients/calories if following specific targets [[C18. Flexible Dieting (IIFYM - If It Fits Your Macros)]].
- Identify sources of key nutrients or ingredients to limit.
- Be critical of front-of-package claims (marketing vs. regulated health claims).
