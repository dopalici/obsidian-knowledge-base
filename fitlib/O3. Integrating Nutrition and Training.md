### O3. Integrating Nutrition and Training

**Created:** 2025-04-25

Aligning nutritional strategies with training demands and goals is crucial for optimizing performance, recovery, adaptation, and body composition. Nutrition provides the fuel for training and the building blocks for recovery/adaptation.

**Key Integration Principles:**
1.  **Energy Availability (EA):** Ensure EA is sufficient to support training load *and* basic physiological function ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]). Match energy intake to daily/weekly energy expenditure fluctuations based on training volume/intensity. Avoid chronic low energy availability (LEA).
2.  **Macronutrient Alignment:** Distribute macronutrients ([[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]]) to support primary training goal:
    - *Endurance Focus:* Prioritize adequate carbohydrates for fuel/glycogen replenishment ([[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]).
    - *Strength/Power Focus:* Ensure sufficient protein for repair/adaptation and adequate carbs for high-intensity fuel ([[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]]).
    - *Hypertrophy Focus:* Ensure adequate protein and energy surplus ([[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]]).
    - *Fat Loss Focus:* Prioritize high protein to preserve LBM within energy deficit ([[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]]).
3.  **Nutrient Timing Integration ([[C3. Nutrient Timing]]):** Plan meals/snacks around training sessions to optimize fuel availability, performance during session, and recovery afterwards.
    - *Pre-Training:* Ensure adequate fuel (esp. carbs) and hydration. ([[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]]).
    - *Intra-Training:* Fuel/hydrate during long/intense sessions as needed. ([[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]]).
    - *Post-Training:* Consume carbs/protein to promote glycogen resynthesis and MPS ([[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]], [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]]).
4.  **Periodized Nutrition:** Align nutritional strategies with training periodization phases ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]], [[K2. Advanced Periodization Strategies]]). Example: Higher calorie/carb intake during high-volume base/hypertrophy phases; potentially lower intake during lower volume taper/recovery phases; specific fueling strategies for competition phase. "Train low, compete high" is an advanced strategy requiring careful implementation.
5.  **Hydration Strategy:** Plan fluid intake before, during, and after training based on duration, intensity, and environmental conditions ([[C4. Hydration]], [[C5. Electrolytes]]).
6.  **Supplement Integration:** Use evidence-based supplements ([[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]) strategically to support specific training goals or address nutritional gaps.

**Practical Application:** Requires communication/coordination if working with separate coach and nutritionist/dietitian. Athlete needs understanding of both plans. Requires planning/preparation.
