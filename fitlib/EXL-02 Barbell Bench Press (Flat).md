### **EXL-02: Barbell Bench Press (Flat)**

**ID:** EXL-02-BB-BENCH **Created:** 2025-04-28

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental upper-body compound exercise performed lying supine on a bench, involving lowering a barbell to the chest and pressing it back up. Primarily develops pushing strength and hypertrophy in the chest, shoulders, and triceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires proper technique for safety and effectiveness, especially with heavier loads).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused reps on chest, Slow Eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Incline Bench Press [[EXL-11 Barbell Incline Bench Press]].
- Floor Press [[EXL-12 Barbell Floor Press]].
- Close-Grip Bench Press (Targets triceps more).
- Add Accommodating Resistance (Bands [[B11. Resistance Bands]], Chains).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Bench Press [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]] (More stabilization required).
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Machine Chest Press [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Smith Machine Bench Press (Use cautiously).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major (sternal and clavicular heads), Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Coracobrachialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Biceps Brachii (co-contraction), Latissimus Dorsi (stabilize descent), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]]. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie supine on bench, feet flat on floor, 5 points of contact (head, upper back, glutes, both feet). Grip barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width, thumbs wrapped. Create slight natural arch in lower back, retract and depress scapulae firmly against bench. Unrack bar with straight arms over upper chest/shoulders.
- **Execution:** Inhale, lower bar under control towards mid-to-lower chest. Keep elbows tucked (~45-75 degrees angle to torso). Touch chest lightly. Exhale and press bar up and slightly back towards starting position over shoulders. Maintain glute contact and shoulder position. Drive through feet.
- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent, exhale during ascent (or Valsalva for heavy lifts).
- **Common Faults:** Excessive elbow flare, bouncing bar, losing shoulder position (shoulders rolling forward), lifting glutes, incorrect bar path, uneven pressing.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff tear), unstable shoulder joint, elbow tendinopathy, recent sternum/rib injury. Modify grip or ROM based on comfort [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Use a spotter for heavy sets/near failure. Use collars/clips. Learn safe unrack/rerack. Avoid excessively wide "bodybuilder" style grips if causing shoulder pain.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max (e.g., 3RM, 5RM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed at a specific load or RPE.
- Bar velocity.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (bar path, elbow tuck, stability).
