\#\#\# A15. Biomechanics: Posture Analysis

\*\*Created:\*\* 2025-04-23

Posture refers to the alignment of body segments in relation to each other and to gravity. Static posture is alignment while stationary; dynamic posture is alignment during movement. Ideal posture minimizes stress on tissues and allows efficient movement.

\*\*Assessment Methods:\*\*  
\- \*\*Visual Observation:\*\* Plumb line analysis (lateral, anterior, posterior views) comparing landmarks to vertical line. Identifying deviations (e.g., forward head, kyphosis, lordosis, pelvic tilt, scoliosis).  
\- \*\*Photographic/Videographic Analysis:\*\* More objective recording.  
\- \*\*Software Analysis:\*\* Specialized tools for measuring angles and distances.

\*\*Common Postural Deviations:\*\*  
\- \*\*Upper Crossed Syndrome:\*\* Tight pectorals/upper traps/levator scapulae; weak deep neck flexors/rhomboids/lower traps. Often leads to forward head, rounded shoulders.  
\- \*\*Lower Crossed Syndrome:\*\* Tight hip flexors/erector spinae; weak glutes/abdominals. Often leads to anterior pelvic tilt, increased lumbar lordosis.  
\- \*\*Pronation Distortion Syndrome:\*\* Excessive foot pronation, often linked to knee valgus and internal hip rotation.

\*\*Implications:\*\* Poor posture can contribute to musculoskeletal pain (back, neck, shoulder), altered movement patterns, reduced movement efficiency, and potentially increased injury risk during exercise. Assessment informs corrective exercise strategies (\[\[F3-INJURY-PREVENTION\]\]). However, the direct link between static posture deviations and pain is complex and not always causal (Slater et al., 2019). Focus should be on movement quality and capacity.
