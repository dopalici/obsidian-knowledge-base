### X2. Cycling (Road, Mountain, Track)
**ID:** X2-CYCLING
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Cycling training involves developing aerobic endurance, muscular strength/endurance (primarily lower body), specific bike handling skills, and tactical awareness depending on the discipline (road racing, time trials, mountain biking, track cycling).

**Physiological Demands:** Highly aerobic, but requires ability to sustain high power outputs at threshold (road/time trial), produce repeated high-power bursts (criteriums, track sprints, MTB climbs), and possess significant muscular endurance. Key metrics: VO2max, Lactate Threshold / Functional Threshold Power (FTP).

**Biomechanical Considerations:**
- **Bike Fit:** Paramount for comfort, power transfer efficiency, aerodynamics (road/TT), and injury prevention. Adjustments to saddle, handlebars, cleats critical. Professional fitting recommended.
- **Pedaling Technique:** Smooth, efficient pedal stroke utilizing full circle. Cadence selection depends on terrain, intensity, individual preference (80-100+ RPM common on road).
- **Discipline Specifics:** Road (aerodynamics, drafting, pack riding skills), Mountain (bike handling skills over technical terrain, explosive power for climbs), Track (high power/speed, specific tactics).

**Training Components:**
- **Aerobic Base:** Long endurance rides at low-moderate intensity (Zone 1-2 / LISS - [[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]).
- **Threshold Training:** Sustained efforts or intervals at or near FTP/LT2 ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]). Often termed "Sweet Spot" training (~88-94% FTP).
- **VO2 Max Intervals:** High-intensity intervals (e.g., 3-8 min) targeting aerobic power ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]).
- **Anaerobic Capacity Work:** Shorter, very high intensity intervals (e.g., 30s-2min).
- **Sprint Training:** Maximal short bursts (<15s).
- **Strength Training:** Important for power production, injury prevention, bone health. Focus on lower body, core stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]), upper body. Schedule to complement riding ([[E4. Concurrent Training (Interference Effect)]]).
- **Periodization ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]):** Phased approach common. Power meters widely used for intensity prescription/monitoring based on FTP zones. Heart rate zones ([[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]]) also used.

**Nutrition & Hydration:** High energy/carbohydrate needs. Intra-ride fueling crucial for sessions >90 min ([[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]). Hydration management vital ([[C4. Hydration]]).

**Common Injuries:** Knee pain (often fit-related), lower back pain (posture/fit), saddle sores, wrist/hand numbness, collarbone fractures (crashes). Overuse injuries often linked to poor bike fit or rapid training increases.
