### A25. Principle of Periodization
**ID:** A25-PRINCIPLE-PERIODIZATION
**Created:** 2025-04-25

*(Content based on FZC-1.7)*
Periodization is the planned, systematic variation of training variables (volume, intensity, etc.) over time (macro-, meso-, micro-cycles) to optimize adaptations, manage fatigue, prevent overtraining ([[M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching]]), and peak performance at specific times. Incorporates planned variation and recovery (related to [[A26. Principle of Recovery]]).

**Models:** Linear, Undulating (Non-linear), Block (See [[K2. Advanced Periodization Strategies]] for details).

**Cycles:** Macrocycle (year/season), Mesocycle (block/phase), Microcycle (week).

**Rationale:** Manage fatigue, optimize specific adaptations sequentially, peak performance via tapering ([[F2. Performance Optimization Factors]]).
