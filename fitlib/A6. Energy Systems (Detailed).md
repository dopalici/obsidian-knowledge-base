The body uses three primary metabolic pathways to regenerate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the immediate energy currency for muscle contraction. These systems operate concurrently, with their relative contributions determined by exercise intensity and duration.

1.  **ATP-PCr System (Phosphagen System):**
    - **Fuel:** Stored ATP and Phosphocreatine (PCr).
    - **Process:** Creatine Kinase reaction. Rapid ATP regeneration.
    - **Characteristics:** Anaerobic, highest power, very limited capacity (~5-15s max effort).
    - **Recovery:** PCr replenishes rapidly during rest (~30-60s half-life).

2.  **Glycolytic System (Anaerobic Glycolysis / Lactic Acid System):**
    - **Fuel:** Glucose/Glycogen.
    - **Process:** Breakdown to pyruvate -> lactate + H+ (fast glycolysis, regenerates NAD+).
    - **Characteristics:** Anaerobic, high power (less than ATP-PCr), limited capacity (~15s to 2-3min high intensity). Metabolite accumulation contributes to fatigue.

3.  **Oxidative System (Aerobic System):**
    - **Fuel:** Pyruvate, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids (minor).
    - **Process:** Mitochondrial respiration (Krebs Cycle & Electron Transport Chain). Requires O2.
    - **Characteristics:** Aerobic, lower power output, virtually unlimited capacity (fuel dependent). Primary system at rest and during submaximal, prolonged exercise (>2-3 min).

**Interaction:** All systems contribute simultaneously; predominance shifts with intensity/duration. Training enhances specific systems based on stimulus ([[A20. Principle of Specificity (SAID)]]).
