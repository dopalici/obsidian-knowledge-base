### **EXL-74: Cable Seated Row (Various grips)**

**ID:** EXL-74-CEX-ROW-SEATEDVARIOUS **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based exercise [[B10. Machine Training]] using a low pulley cable station, performed seated with feet braced, involving pulling a handle attachment towards the torso. Targets the back muscles, with different grip attachments emphasizing different areas. Provides constant tension.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Strong peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Grip Attachments:
    - Close Neutral Grip (V-bar): Emphasizes lats, mid-back thickness.
    - Wide Pronated Grip (Lat bar): Emphasizes upper back, rear delts, traps more.
    - Single D-Handles (Neutral/Rotating): Allows greater ROM and unilateral focus.
- Progress to unsupported rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Machine Seated Row (Chest Supported) [[EXL-57 Seated Row (Machine - Close GripNeutral)]] / [[EXL-58 Chest Supported Row (Machine)]].
- Resistance Band Rows [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle & Lower). (Emphasis shifts with grip).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Erector Spinae (isometric).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hamstrings/Glutes (bracing).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit at cable row station, feet firmly on foot pads, knees slightly bent. Grasp desired handle attachment. Sit upright with neutral spine, chest up. Lean forward slightly from hips to allow arms to fully extend and feel stretch in back (scapular protraction).
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by retracting scapulae (drive chest up, pull shoulders back). Exhale and pull handle towards torso (typically lower abdomen for close grip, mid/upper abdomen for wider grips), keeping torso relatively upright (minimal lean back/momentum). Drive elbows back. Squeeze back muscles at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly return handle to starting position under control, allowing scapulae to protract.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Excessive torso swing/momentum, rounding lower back, shrugging shoulders, pulling primarily with arms, incomplete range of motion (especially scapular movement).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back, shoulder, or elbow injuries. Requires maintaining good posture.
- **Safety:** Maintain neutral spine. Control the weight. Avoid excessive lean/momentum. Focus on initiating with scapulae.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal swing, scapular control, pull path) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
