### **EXL-89: Abdominal Crunch / Sit-up (Floor or Bench)**

**ID:** EXL-89-BW-CRUNCH **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A common bodyweight exercise [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] involving flexing the spine to lift the head and shoulders (crunch) or the entire torso (sit-up) off the floor or a bench, primarily targeting the rectus abdominis.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (Holding weight plate on chest/behind head).
- Decline Crunches/Sit-ups (increases difficulty).
- Cable Crunches [[EXL-101 Cable Crunch]].
- Hanging Leg/Knee Raises [[EXL-88 Hanging Leg Raise  Knee Raise (Captain's Chair or Pull-up Bar)]].
- V-Ups / Tuck Crunches.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Reduce Range of Motion.
- Focus on abdominal bracing / Hollow Body Hold [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]].
- Planks [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]].
- Dead Bug exercise [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Rectus Abdominis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Obliques (Internal & External). Hip Flexors (especially active during sit-ups).
- **Stabilizers:** Transverse Abdominis.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Crunch):** Lie supine on floor or mat, knees bent, feet flat on floor hip-width apart. Place hands lightly behind head (don't pull on neck) or across chest.
- **Setup (Sit-up):** Same as crunch, may need feet anchored for full sit-up.
- **Execution (Crunch):** Exhale and contract abdominals to lift head, shoulders, and upper back off the floor (spinal flexion). Focus on bringing rib cage towards pelvis. Keep lower back pressed into floor. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly lower back to starting position under control.
- **Execution (Sit-up):** Continue lifting torso off floor until nearly upright. Often involves significant hip flexor activation. Control the descent.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during upward phase (concentric), inhale during lowering phase (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pulling on neck, using momentum, lifting lower back off floor (crunch), relying too heavily on hip flexors (sit-up), uncontrolled movement.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute neck pain, acute low back pain (especially disc issues aggravated by flexion). Repeated spinal flexion exercises are debated for long-term spine health; core stability exercises [[L4. Core Stability Training]] are often preferred. Caution with diastasis recti.
- **Safety:** Avoid pulling on the neck. Focus on contracting abdominal muscles. Control the movement. Consider alternatives if experiencing back pain.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed for specific sets (bodyweight or weighted).
- Qualitative assessment of form (controlled spinal flexion, minimal momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
