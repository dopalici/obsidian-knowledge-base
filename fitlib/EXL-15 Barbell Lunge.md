**EXL-15: Barbell Lunge**

**ID:** EXL-15-BB-LUNGE **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A unilateral lower-body exercise involving stepping forward or backward into a lunge position while supporting a barbell across the upper back. Develops single-leg strength, stability, balance, and hypertrophy, placing high demands on coordination and core stability.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires significant balance, stability, and strength compared to dumbbell or bodyweight versions).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused at bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Walking Barbell Lunges.
- Barbell Reverse Lunges.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Empty Bar.
- Dumbbell Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]] (load held lower, easier balance).
- Bodyweight Lunges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Barbell Split Squat (static stance, less balance demand).
- Improve balance [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]] and core stability [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus (of lead leg).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings (lead leg), Adductor Magnus, Gluteus Medius/Minimus (hip stability).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature (significant demand), Erector Spinae, Upper Back (supporting bar), Calves, Foot/Ankle stabilizers. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place barbell across upper back (similar to high bar squat position [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]]). Unrack bar, take stable stance, feet hip-width. Brace core tightly.
- **Execution (Forward Lunge Example):** Step forward a moderate distance with one leg. Lower hips straight down under control until both knees are near 90 degrees. Front knee tracks over foot, back knee hovers above floor. Maintain upright torso and neutral spine. Drive forcefully through front foot heel/mid-foot to return to starting position. Alternate legs. Keep core braced throughout.
- **Execution (Reverse Lunge Example):** Step backward, lowering hips until knees near 90 degrees. Drive through front foot to return to start.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Losing balance, front knee collapsing inward (valgus), excessive forward torso lean, insufficient depth, pushing off back foot predominantly in forward lunge, poor core control.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Significant balance impairments, acute knee or hip injuries. Requires good core stability and balance [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Master bodyweight and dumbbell lunges first. Start with empty bar or very light weight. Ensure adequate space. Focus on control and balance. Be prepared to bail safely if balance is lost (practice recommended).

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load or bodyweight.
- Qualitative assessment of form (balance, torso position, knee tracking, depth).
