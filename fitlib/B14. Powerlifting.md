### B14. Powerlifting
**ID:** B14-POWERLIFTING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Powerlifting is a strength sport focused on achieving the highest possible total weight lifted across three specific barbell lifts: the Back Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift.

**Competition Lifts:** Back Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift (Conventional or Sumo stance). Specific rules apply to technique/depth/pauses.

**Training Principles:**
- **Specificity:** Primary focus on mastering technique and building maximal strength in the three competition lifts ([[A20. Principle of Specificity (SAID)]], [[B4. Strength Training Principles]]).
- **Progressive Overload:** Systematically increasing load on competition lifts and key assistance exercises ([[B1. Progressive Overload]]).
- **Periodization:** Essential for managing high intensity/volume and peaking for competitions. Models like linear, undulating, block, or conjugate are commonly used ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]], [[K2. Advanced Periodization Strategies]]).
- **Assistance Exercises:** Target weak points, build muscle mass supporting the main lifts (e.g., overhead press, rows, lunges, good mornings, glute-ham raises).
- **Technique:** Highly refined technique crucial for maximizing weight lifted safely and meeting competition standards.
- **Recovery:** High neural and systemic demands require meticulous recovery management ([[B6. Rest and Recovery for Optimal Adaptation (Resistance Training Focus)]], [[M. Recovery Strategies]]).

**Considerations:** High risk of injury if technique is poor or load management inadequate. Requires specific equipment (barbells, racks, benches).
