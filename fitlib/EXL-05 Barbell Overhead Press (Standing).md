### **EXL-05: Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

**ID:** EXL-05-BB-OHP _(Note: This was previously EXL-06 in sequential generation, adjusted to match list)_ **Created:** 2025-04-28

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental upper-body compound exercise involving pressing a barbell from the front rack position (shoulders) to an overhead locked-out position while standing. Develops vertical pushing strength and hypertrophy, primarily targeting the shoulders and triceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires shoulder mobility, core stability, and proper technique to perform safely, especially with heavy loads).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (paused reps overhead, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Push Press (uses leg drive to initiate).
- Jerk variations (split, push, squat - more complex power movements) [[B15. Olympic Weightlifting]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Seated Barbell Press (reduces stability requirement).
- Dumbbell Overhead Press [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]].
- Machine Shoulder Press [[EXL-52 Shoulder Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Landmine Press.
- Improve shoulder and thoracic mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- Improve core stability [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid, Medial Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Upper Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Serratus Anterior, Trapezius (upper and middle).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature, Rotator Cuff, Erector Spinae, Glutes, Legs (isometric). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand feet shoulder-width. Grip bar slightly wider than shoulders. Bar rests on anterior deltoids/upper chest, elbows slightly forward. Upright torso. Brace core, squeeze glutes.
- **Execution:** Inhale, brace. Press bar vertically overhead (straight line or slight backward path as head clears). Push head slightly forward "through window" at lockout. Bar aligned over shoulders/mid-foot. Full lockout, stable shoulders. Lower under control to start.
- **Breathing:** Inhale/brace before press, exhale through sticking point/at lockout.
- **Common Faults:** Excessive backward lean/lumbar hyperextension, pressing bar forward, unstable overhead position, using leg drive (unless intended), insufficient core bracing.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff), significant shoulder mobility restrictions, uncontrolled hypertension [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]]. May aggravate low back if core unstable.
- **Safety:** Master technique first. Ensure mobility. Maintain core control. Avoid hitting face. Consider rack safeties for heavy attempts if needed.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed at a specific load or RPE.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (bar path, spinal neutrality, overhead stability).
