**ID:** C10-MEDITERRANEAN-DIET **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) reflects the traditional dietary patterns of populations in Mediterranean regions (e.g., Greece, Southern Italy, Spain). It is not a single prescribed diet but rather a pattern characterized by high consumption of plant-based foods and healthy fats. It is one of the most researched dietary patterns and consistently linked to significant health benefits, particularly cardiovascular health [].

**Key Characteristics:**

- **High Intake:**
    - Fruits and Vegetables (diverse, abundant)
    - Whole Grains (breads, pasta, rice)
    - Legumes (beans, lentils, peas)
    - Nuts and Seeds
    - Olive Oil (especially Extra Virgin) as the principal source of added fat [[A3. Macronutrients]]
    - Fish and Seafood (especially fatty fish rich in Omega-3s, consumed ≥2 times/week)
- **Moderate Intake:**
    - Poultry
    - Dairy products (primarily yogurt and cheese)
    - Eggs
    - Wine (moderate consumption, typically with meals - optional)
- **Low Intake:**
    - Red Meat and Processed Meats
    - Sweets, sugary drinks, pastries
    - Refined Grains
    - Butter and other saturated fats

**Evidence-Based Health Benefits:**

- **Cardiovascular Health:** Strong evidence for reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, and overall cardiovascular mortality. Improves blood pressure, lipid profiles (lowers LDL, increases HDL), endothelial function, and reduces inflammation markers (e.g., hs-CRP) [[C33. Anti-Inflammatory FoodsDiets]], []. The PREDIMED trial provided landmark evidence [].
- **Metabolic Health:** Associated with reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes and improved glycemic control.
- **Cognitive Function:** Linked to slower cognitive decline and reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.
- **Weight Management:** Can support healthy weight management due to high fiber, nutrient density, and satiety value, although not primarily designed as a weight-loss diet.
- **Cancer Risk:** Associated with lower risk of certain cancers.
- **Longevity & Quality of Life:** Linked to lower overall mortality and improved quality of life metrics (physical function, general health, energy) [].

**Fitness & Performance Considerations:**

- Provides ample carbohydrates from whole food sources to fuel training [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]].
- Rich in micronutrients [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]] and antioxidants [[C34. Antioxidants]], supporting recovery and overall health.
- Emphasizes anti-inflammatory components [[C33. Anti-Inflammatory FoodsDiets]], which may benefit recovery.
- May require conscious effort to ensure very high protein intake if maximal hypertrophy is the primary goal [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]], although adequate protein is achievable.
