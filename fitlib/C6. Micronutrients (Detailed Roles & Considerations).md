**ID:** C6-MICRONUTRIENTS-DETAILED **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Expanding on [[A4. Micronutrients]], this note details specific vitamins and minerals pertinent to exercise performance, recovery, and overall health. While balanced diets often meet general needs, athletes may have increased requirements or specific risks for certain micronutrients due to higher turnover, losses (e.g., sweat), or dietary restrictions [].

**Key Micronutrients for Active Individuals:**

- **Vitamin D:**
    - **Roles:** Crucial for calcium absorption, bone health [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]], immune function, and muscle function (Vitamin D Receptors found in muscle tissue).
    - **Sources:** Sunlight exposure (UVB), fatty fish, fortified foods (dairy, cereals), egg yolks, supplements.
    - **Considerations:** Insufficiency/deficiency is widespread globally. Athletes (especially indoor athletes, those living at higher latitudes, or with darker skin) are at risk. Deficiency linked to impaired muscle function, bone health issues, and potentially increased URTI risk. Status assessment (serum 25(OH)D) is recommended. Supplementation (e.g., 1000-4000 IU/day) often required to achieve optimal levels (>75 nmol/L or 30 ng/mL) [].
- **Iron:**
    - **Roles:** Essential component of hemoglobin (oxygen transport in blood) and myoglobin (oxygen storage in muscle), crucial for aerobic energy production [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]].
    - **Sources:** Heme iron (more bioavailable: meat, poultry, fish), Non-heme iron (plants: legumes, grains, leafy greens - absorption enhanced by Vitamin C, inhibited by phytates/polyphenols).
    - **Considerations:** Athletes, particularly female, endurance, vegetarian/vegan athletes, are at higher risk for iron deficiency due to increased losses (sweat, GI bleeding, menstruation) and potentially inadequate intake/absorption. Iron deficiency progresses from depletion (low ferritin) to iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and finally iron-deficiency anemia (low hemoglobin), significantly impairing endurance performance. Routine screening (ferritin) recommended for at-risk athletes. Supplementation only advised if deficient, under medical supervision [].
- **Calcium:**
    - **Roles:** Primary structural component of bone, essential for muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting.
    - **Sources:** Dairy products, fortified plant milks/tofu, bony fish (sardines), leafy greens (kale, broccoli).
    - **Considerations:** Crucial alongside Vitamin D for bone health, especially during adolescence and for athletes at risk of low energy availability (LEA) or menstrual dysfunction [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]], [[I2. Female-Specific Physiological Considerations]]. Adequate intake vital throughout life.
- **Magnesium:**
    - **Roles:** Cofactor for >300 enzymatic reactions, including those in energy metabolism (ATP function), protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation.
    - **Sources:** Nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, leafy green vegetables, dark chocolate.
    - **Considerations:** Involved in muscle contraction and relaxation. Increased losses occur through sweat. Marginal deficiency may be common and could potentially affect performance or recovery, although evidence for ergogenic effects of supplementation in sufficient individuals is limited [].
- **Zinc:**
    - **Roles:** Cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in metabolism, immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, antioxidant defense.
    - **Sources:** Meat, poultry, oysters, shellfish, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains.
    - **Considerations:** Important for immune health and recovery. Bioavailability lower from plant sources due to phytates. Severe deficiency impairs immunity, but effects of marginal deficiency on athletes less clear. Excessive supplementation can interfere with copper absorption.
- **B Vitamins (Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12):**
    - **Roles:** Act as coenzymes essential for energy metabolism (breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, proteins). B12 and folate crucial for red blood cell formation and neurological function.
    - **Sources:** Widely distributed in foods (meats, dairy, eggs, grains, legumes, vegetables). B12 primarily from animal sources.
    - **Considerations:** Exercise increases turnover, but deficiency is uncommon in athletes consuming adequate energy and varied diets. Vegans/strict vegetarians **must** supplement B12 or consume reliably fortified foods [[C11. Vegetarian & Vegan Diets]].
- **Antioxidant Micronutrients (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium):**
    - **Roles:** Protect cells from oxidative damage [[C34. Antioxidants]].
    - **Considerations:** While essential, high-dose supplementation may blunt training adaptations. Obtain primarily through a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds [].

**Assessment & Supplementation:** A nutrient-dense, varied diet [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]] is the primary strategy. Supplementation should be targeted based on diagnosed deficiency or inadequacy identified through blood tests and dietary analysis, under the guidance of a healthcare professional or sports dietitian [[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching]].
