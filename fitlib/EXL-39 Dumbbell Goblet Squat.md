### **EXL-39: Dumbbell Goblet Squat**

**ID:** EXL-39-DB-GOBLETSQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A squat variation where a single dumbbell (or kettlebell [[B9. Kettlebell Training]]) is held vertically against the chest with both hands. This anterior load acts as a counterbalance, promoting a more upright torso and making it an excellent tool for learning proper squat mechanics.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Progress to Barbell Front Squat [[EXL-08 Barbell Front Squat]] (similar upright posture, heavier load potential).
- Progress to Barbell Back Squat [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]].
- Double Kettlebell Front Squat [[B9. Kettlebell Training]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use lighter dumbbell/kettlebell.
- Bodyweight Squat [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Use assistance (e.g., hold onto TRX straps [[B12. Suspension Training (TRX)]]).
- Improve Hip/Ankle Mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Hamstrings, Soleus.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Core musculature (significant anti-flexion demand) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Upper Back (supporting weight), Biceps (holding weight).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width, toes pointed slightly out. Hold one end of a dumbbell vertically with both hands cupped underneath the top part, keeping dumbbell close to chest. Elbows tucked in.
- **Execution:** Brace core. Initiate squat by breaking at hips and knees simultaneously. Descend by "sitting back and down" between legs, keeping chest up and torso as upright as possible. Keep elbows inside knees. Track knees over toes. Descend as deep as possible while maintaining neutral spine (aim for hip crease below knee). Drive up through mid-foot back to starting position, extending hips and knees.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Leaning too far forward, rounding lower back ("butt wink"), knees caving inward (valgus), elbows hitting knees excessively limiting depth, insufficient depth.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee, hip, or low back injuries. Wrist discomfort may occur with heavy dumbbells.
- **Safety:** Maintain upright torso and neutral spine. Keep dumbbell secure and close to chest. Control movement. Ensure adequate mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (depth, torso angle, knee tracking, spinal position) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
