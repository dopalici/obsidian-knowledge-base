### **EXL-64: Hip Adduction (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-64-MEX-HIPADD **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]], involving squeezing the legs inward against resistance pads while seated. Primarily targets the adductor muscles of the inner thigh.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak adduction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cable Hip Adduction.
- Copenhagen Adduction Exercise (Bodyweight or weighted).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Hip Adduction [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Stability Ball Squeezes (Isometric) [[B19. Isometrics]].
- Focus on compound exercises involving adductors (Squats [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]], Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Adductor Magnus, Adductor Longus, Adductor Brevis, Pectineus, Gracilis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Lower fibers of Gluteus Maximus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hip Abductors (eccentric control).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on machine with inner thighs/knees pressed against the outside of the pads. Adjust machine starting position so legs are comfortably abducted (spread apart). Sit upright with back supported, core engaged. Grip handles for stability.
- **Execution:** Exhale and squeeze legs together (adduct hips) against the pads, controlling the movement through the available range of motion. Focus on contracting the inner thigh muscles. Pause briefly at the point of maximum adduction. Inhale and slowly allow legs to return to the starting abducted position under control (eccentric abduction).
- **Breathing:** Exhale during adduction (concentric), inhale during abduction/return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled eccentric phase, lifting hips/shifting position.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute groin strain or hip injury. Avoid forcing range of motion beyond comfortable limits.
- **Safety:** Ensure machine is adjusted correctly. Use appropriate weight allowing controlled movement. Avoid slamming weights at end ROM.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
