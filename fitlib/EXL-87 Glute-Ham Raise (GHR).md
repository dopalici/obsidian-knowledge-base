### **EXL-87: Glute-Ham Raise (GHR)**

**ID:** EXL-87-BW-GHR **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An advanced bodyweight exercise [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] performed on a dedicated Glute-Ham Raise apparatus [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]]. It involves lowering the torso towards parallel by extending the knees, followed by pulling back up using primarily the hamstrings and glutes. Excellent for posterior chain development.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires significant hamstring and glute strength).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (Holding weight plate/dumbbell) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at bottom).
- Full Glute-Ham Raise (minimal push-off assistance).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Use Assistance Band [[B11. Resistance Bands]] looped around machine/shoulders.
- Eccentric Only Glute-Ham Raises (push back up with hands).
- Back Extensions [[EXL-86 Back Extension  Hyperextension (Bench)]].
- Nordic Hamstring Curls (similar eccentric focus, different setup).
- Stability Ball Hamstring Curls [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Lying Leg Curls [[EXL-49 Lying Leg Curl (Machine)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Hamstrings (knee flexion focus), Gluteus Maximus (hip extension focus on way up).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Gastrocnemius, Erector Spinae (isometric), Calves.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Upper Back.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust foot plate and knee pad so knees rest comfortably on pad and feet are secured against plate. Start in upright position, torso perpendicular to floor, knees bent. Maintain neutral spine, core braced. Cross arms over chest or place hands behind head.
- **Execution:** Initiate by slowly lowering torso forward/downwards by extending knees, keeping body rigid from knees to head (maintain hip extension/neutral spine). Lower until torso is parallel to floor or as far as possible under control. Initiate ascent by forcefully flexing knees (pulling with hamstrings) and simultaneously extending hips (squeezing glutes) to return to upright starting position. May require slight push-off from hands on pad during learning phase.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent (eccentric), exhale during ascent (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Breaking at the hips (flexing hips instead of keeping body straight during descent), excessive arching of lower back, using excessive hand push-off, incomplete range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute hamstring or knee injuries. Can be very demanding on hamstrings.
- **Safety:** Master regressions first (e.g., negatives, back extensions). Ensure GHR apparatus is adjusted correctly. Control the movement, especially the eccentric phase. Use assistance bands or hand push-off until sufficient strength is developed.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed (bodyweight or assisted/weighted) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Level of assistance needed.
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip/spine position, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
