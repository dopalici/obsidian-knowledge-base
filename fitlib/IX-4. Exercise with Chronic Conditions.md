**ID:** IX-4-EXERCISE-CHRONIC-CONDITIONS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Regular exercise is a cornerstone of prevention and management for numerous chronic health conditions. Tailoring exercise prescription to accommodate specific conditions, limitations, and safety concerns is essential. (Consolidates and expands on [[G3. Training with Health Limitations  Chronic Conditions]]).

**General Benefits:** Improved cardiovascular health, metabolic control, functional capacity, symptom reduction, mental health, quality of life.

**General Principles:** Medical clearance often needed. Individualize program. Start low, progress slow. Monitor symptoms. Be aware of medication effects. Focus on function.

**Examples & Considerations:**
- **CVD/Hypertension:** Cardiac rehab often initial step. Moderate aerobic + resistance training beneficial. Monitor HR/BP. Avoid Valsalva if uncontrolled HTN.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Combine aerobic & resistance. Monitor blood glucose (hypoglycemia risk). Foot care.
- **Obesity:** High volume activity (>250 min/week) + resistance training. Low-impact options if joint pain.
- **Arthritis (OA/RA):** Low-impact aerobic, strength training, ROM exercises. Exercise during lower inflammation periods.
- **Osteoporosis:** Weight-bearing aerobic, resistance training, balance exercises. Avoid spinal flexion/high-impact if severe. Ensure adequate Calcium/Vit D.
- **COPD:** Pulmonary rehab. Aerobic exercise limited by dyspnea. Resistance training beneficial. Breathing techniques.
- **Lower Back Pain (Non-specific):** Stay active. Aerobic conditioning. Core stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]). Mobility work. Proper mechanics ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]).

**Professional Guidance:** Collaboration between healthcare providers and qualified exercise professionals often necessary.
