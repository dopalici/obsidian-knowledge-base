### **EXL-18: Yates Row (Underhand Barbell Row)**

**ID:** EXL-18-BB-YATESROW **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A barbell bent-over row variation popularized by bodybuilder Dorian Yates, characterized by a more upright torso angle (typically ~45-70 degrees) and an underhand (supinated) grip. Allows for potentially heavier loads and greater biceps involvement compared to pronated grip rows.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Pronated Grip Barbell Row [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]] (potentially less stress on biceps tendon).
- Dumbbell Rows [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]].
- Seated Cable Rows [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]].
- Machine Rows [[EXL-57 Seated Row (Machine - Close GripNeutral)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (Middle & Lower), Rhomboids.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Biceps Brachii (significant involvement due to supinated grip), Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid, Erector Spinae (isometric).
- **Stabilizers:** Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Forearm flexors (grip). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-to-shoulder width apart. Grip barbell with underhand (supinated) grip, typically shoulder-width apart. Hinge at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] while keeping knees slightly bent, maintaining a neutral spine. Torso angle is more upright than parallel (approx. 45-70 degrees from horizontal). Let arms hang straight.
- **Execution:** Brace core. Pull barbell towards lower abdomen/hip crease, driving elbows back. Focus on contracting back muscles and biceps. Keep torso angle relatively stable, allowing for slight controlled movement ("body English") with heavier loads but avoid excessive jerking. Squeeze at peak contraction. Lower bar under control back to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Excessive momentum/body swing, rounding lower back, shrugging shoulders, incomplete range of motion, pulling bar too high towards chest.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injuries, biceps tendinopathy or elbow issues (supinated grip can stress biceps tendon more) [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]]. Requires good spinal control.
- **Safety:** Maintain neutral spine. Control the movement, limit excessive momentum. Use appropriate weight. Be mindful of potential biceps stress.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (controlled momentum, spinal posture, pull path).
