### **EXL-93: Stationary Bike (Upright)**

**ID:** EXL-93-CARDIO-BIKEUPRIGHT **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A piece of cardiovascular exercise equipment [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] simulating outdoor cycling in an upright posture. Provides a low-impact workout primarily targeting the lower body and cardiovascular system [[E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)]].

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (adjustable resistance/speed/duration).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Resistance Level [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Cadence (RPM) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]] / [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].
- Perform standing intervals (if bike design allows).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Resistance Level.
- Decrease Cadence (RPM).
- Decrease Duration.
- Use Recumbent Bike [[EXL-94 Stationary Bike (Recumbent)]] (more back support).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (for posture).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so there is a slight bend in the knee at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Adjust handlebars for comfortable upright posture.
- **Execution:** Pedal with smooth, circular motion. Maintain good posture, core engaged. Avoid gripping handlebars too tightly. Maintain desired cadence/resistance.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing.
- **Common Faults:** Seat too high/low, poor posture (slouching), bouncing on seat at high cadence, insufficient resistance.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries may require modification. Generally well-tolerated due to low impact. May cause discomfort for individuals with significant low back pain depending on posture.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat/handlebar setup. Start with lower resistance/duration. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Resistance Level, Cadence (RPM), Distance (often estimated), Watts (if available) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
