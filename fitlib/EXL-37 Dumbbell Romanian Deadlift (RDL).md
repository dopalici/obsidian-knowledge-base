### **EXL-37: Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**

**ID:** EXL-37-DB-RDL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A hip hinge exercise using dumbbells, involving lowering the weights towards the floor by pushing the hips back while maintaining a nearly straight leg position and a neutral spine. Primarily targets the hamstrings and glutes, similar to the barbell RDL but allowing a more natural hand position.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at bottom stretch).
- Single-Leg Dumbbell RDL (significantly increases balance/stability demand [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]).
- Barbell RDL [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].
- Barbell Good Morning [[EXL-10 Barbell Good Morning]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Kettlebell Swings/Deadlifts [[B9. Kettlebell Training]] (to practice hinge).
- Back Extensions [[EXL-86 Back Extension  Hyperextension (Bench)]].
- Glute Bridges / Hip Thrusts [[EXL-07 Barbell Hip Thrust]].
- Improve hamstring flexibility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]] and hip hinge pattern [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Hamstrings (eccentric/isometric emphasis), Gluteus Maximus (concentric hip extension).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Erector Spinae (isometric stabilization), Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Upper Back (Latissimus Dorsi, Traps, Rhomboids - keep shoulders back), Forearm flexors (grip).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells in front of thighs with palms facing body (neutral or pronated grip). Knees slightly bent ("soft knees"). Maintain neutral spine, chest up, shoulders back.
- **Execution:** Initiate movement by pushing hips backward (hip hinge [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]), keeping back straight. Lower dumbbells towards floor, keeping them close to legs. Maintain slight knee bend. Lower as far as hamstring flexibility allows while maintaining neutral spine (feel stretch). Drive hips forward forcefully to return to starting position, squeezing glutes at top.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering (eccentric), exhale during hip extension (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rounding lower back, bending knees too much, letting dumbbells drift away from body, hyperextending back at top, initiating with spinal flexion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injury (disc issues, strains), acute hamstring strain. Requires good hamstring flexibility and ability to maintain spinal neutrality.
- **Safety:** Master hip hinge pattern first. Prioritize neutral spine. Keep dumbbells close. Control eccentric phase. Don't force ROM beyond flexibility.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip hinge quality, spinal neutrality, depth) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
