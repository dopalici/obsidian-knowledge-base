### **EXL-100: Assault Bike / Air Bike**

**ID:** EXL-100-CARDIO-AIRBIKE **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A type of stationary bike [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] that uses a fan for resistance â€“ the harder you pedal and push/pull the handles, the greater the air resistance becomes. Provides a demanding full-body, high-intensity cardiovascular workout. Often used in CrossFit [[X10. CrossFit]] and functional fitness settings.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (intensity is self-paced based on effort). Can be extremely demanding at high intensities.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Pace / Effort Level (RPM, Watts, Calories/min) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Focus on Arms Only or Legs Only intervals.
- Incorporate High-Intensity Intervals [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]] (e.g., Tabata, max calorie sprints).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Pace / Effort Level.
- Decrease Duration.
- Use Legs Only (rest arms on lap or stationary pegs).
- Use Arms Only (rest feet on stationary pegs).
- Use standard stationary bike [[EXL-93 Stationary Bike (Upright)]] or elliptical [[EXL-92 Elliptical Trainer]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]]. Both Aerobic and Anaerobic energy systems heavily taxed at high intensity [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves (pedaling); Pectorals, Deltoids, Triceps (pushing handles); Lats, Biceps, Rhomboids (pulling handles). High degree of full-body muscle engagement.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]] (General Posture)

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height and fore/aft position for proper leg extension (slight knee bend at bottom of pedal stroke). Grip moving handles.
- **Execution:** Coordinate pushing/pulling with arms and pedaling with legs simultaneously. Maintain relatively upright posture, core engaged. Drive hard with both upper and lower body for maximal intensity, or maintain a steady pace for endurance.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing appropriate for intensity; likely deep and rapid during high effort.
- **Common Faults:** Poor seat adjustment, inconsistent effort, poor posture (excessive slouching or hunching).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute injuries (shoulder, knee, hip, back). Can be extremely demanding cardiovascularly; caution advised for individuals with certain heart conditions [[Q5. Exercise Considerations for Health Conditions Overview]].
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat setup. Start with lower intensity/duration to gauge effort. Be prepared for rapid fatigue at high intensities. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Distance (estimated), RPM [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Power Output (Watts - often displayed).
- Calories burned (monitor display - use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
- Time to complete specific work intervals (e.g., time to reach X calories).
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
