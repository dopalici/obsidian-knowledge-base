### L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development
**ID:** L2-MOBILITY-FLEXIBILITY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Mobility and flexibility are related but distinct concepts crucial for optimal movement quality, performance, and potentially injury prevention.

- **Flexibility:** The passive range of motion (ROM) available at a joint or series of joints. Primarily determined by the extensibility of soft tissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, skin). Assessed passively (e.g., static stretching reach).
- **Mobility:** The ability to actively move a joint through its full ROM with control. Requires not only flexibility but also adequate strength, stability, and neuromuscular coordination ([[G-VII-3. Neurophysiology of Movement]]) to control the movement throughout the range. Assessed actively (e.g., overhead squat quality, active straight leg raise).

**Importance:**
- **Movement Efficiency:** Allows joints to move through required ranges for functional tasks ([[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]) and sport-specific skills without compensation.
- **Performance:** Optimal ROM can enhance force production potential and technique execution.
- **Injury Prevention:** Significant limitations or asymmetries may contribute to altered biomechanics and increased tissue stress ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]). Hypermobility can also be problematic.
- **Posture & Joint Health:** Contributes to better posture ([[A15. Biomechanics Posture Analysis]]) and joint health.

**Development Methods:**
- **Flexibility Focused:**
    - *Static Stretching:* Holding stretches (15-60s). Best post-activity.
    - *PNF Stretching:* Contract-relax techniques. Highly effective.
- **Mobility Focused:**
    - *Dynamic Stretching:* Controlled movements through ROM. Ideal for warm-ups (related to [[F2. Performance Optimization Factors]]).
    - *Mobility Drills:* Specific exercises targeting joint ROM with active control (e.g., CARs).
    - *Yoga/Pilates:* Incorporate flexibility, mobility, stability, control.
    - *Myofascial Release (Foam Rolling, etc.):* May temporarily improve ROM via neurological effects ([[M1. Recovery Modalities Evidence and Application]]).
    - *Strength Training Through Full ROM:* Resistance training performed correctly through a joint's full range can itself improve/maintain active mobility.

**Implementation:** Balanced approach incorporating both, tailored to individual needs identified via assessment ([[A17. Movement Screening]]). Active control (mobility) often more functional than passive flexibility alone.
