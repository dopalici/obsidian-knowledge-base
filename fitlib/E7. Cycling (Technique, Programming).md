### E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)
**ID:** E7-CYCLING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Cycling (indoor or outdoor) is a low-impact cardiovascular activity popular for fitness, recreation, and competition.

**Technique Fundamentals:**
- **Bike Fit:** Crucial for comfort, efficiency, injury prevention. Professional fitting recommended.
- **Pedaling Mechanics:** Smooth, circular motion ("ankling"). Maintain stable upper body.
- **Cadence (RPM):** Generally 80-100 RPM common for efficient road cycling. Varies with intensity/terrain.
- **Gear Selection:** Maintain desired cadence across varying conditions.
- **Posture:** Varies with bike type. Generally neutral spine, relaxed shoulders.

**Programming Components:**
- **Base Building:** Longer rides at low-moderate intensity ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]).
- **Intensity:** Incorporate Endurance Rides, Tempo/Threshold Rides ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]), VO2 Max Intervals ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]), Anaerobic Capacity Intervals, Sprint Intervals.
- **Power Zones:** Training often structured around power output zones relative to FTP (Functional Threshold Power). Heart rate zones ([[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]]) also used.
- **Periodization ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]):** Phased approach common for competitive cyclists.
- **Indoor Training:** Smart trainers allow structured workouts.

**Considerations:** Low impact. Requires specific equipment. Bike fit critical.
