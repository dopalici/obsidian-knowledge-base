# A28. Advanced Movement Assessment Methodologies

## Conceptual Overview

While foundational movement screening [[A17. Movement Screening]] (like FMS™ or Overhead Squat Assessment) identifies gross limitations in fundamental patterns, advanced movement assessment delves deeper. It often involves more quantitative measures, region-specific testing, analysis of dynamic tasks, or clinical reasoning to diagnose movement dysfunction contributing to pain or performance limitations, particularly in rehabilitation or high-performance settings.

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Regional Interdependence:** The concept that dysfunction in one body region can influence pain or performance in another (e.g., limited hip mobility affecting low back pain during squats).
- **Movement Impairment Syndromes (Sahrmann):** Classifying movement dysfunction based on the direction of faulty movement or alignment during specific tests, suggesting underlying muscle imbalances or stiffness patterns.
- **Clinical Reasoning:** Integrating assessment findings with patient history, symptom behavior, and knowledge of anatomy/biomechanics to form a hypothesis about the root cause of movement issues.
- **Biomechanical Analysis:** Utilizing technology (motion capture, force plates) for quantitative analysis of kinematics (joint angles, velocities) and kinetics (forces, torques) during specific tasks [[A16. Biomechanics Gait Analysis]], [[X11.7 Sprinting Biomechanics & Force Analysis]].

## Practical Applications & Methodologies

- **Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA™):** A clinical assessment system designed for individuals _with pain_. Uses a top-tier set of movements to identify painful patterns, then breaks down dysfunctional non-painful patterns into more specific mobility or stability/motor control deficits using standardized tests. Requires specific certification.
- **Systematic Regional Examination:** Detailed assessment of specific joints or regions identified as problematic during screening or history (e.g., assessing specific shoulder internal/external rotation ROM and strength, hip flexor length tests, ankle dorsiflexion tests).
- **Dynamic Movement Analysis:** Observing movement quality during more complex or sport-specific tasks (e.g., jumping, landing, cutting, throwing). Identifying compensatory patterns under load or fatigue. Tools like the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) quantify landing mechanics.
- **Quantitative Analysis:**
    - _3D Motion Capture:_ Gold standard for detailed kinematic analysis in research/elite settings.
    - _Force Plates:_ Measure ground reaction forces during activities like jumping, landing, walking, running [[A16. Biomechanics Gait Analysis]].
    - _Electromyography (EMG):_ Assess muscle activation patterns and timing [[G-VII-3. Neurophysiology of Movement]].
    - _Wearable Sensors (IMUs):_ Increasingly used for field-based assessment of movement quantity and quality, although validity for specific clinical interpretations is still evolving [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs).md]].

## Research Support

- SFMA™ shows reasonable reliability among trained clinicians for identifying dysfunctional patterns. Its direct link to predicting injury or outcomes requires further research.
- Quantitative biomechanical analysis provides objective data but can be resource-intensive and findings may not always directly translate to simple interventions.
- Recent reviews question the standalone predictive validity of broad screens like FMS™ for injury, suggesting multifactorial approaches incorporating load management, injury history, and potentially more specific assessments are needed. Technology-driven, personalized assessments show future promise.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Advanced assessments often require specialized training, clinical expertise, or expensive equipment.
- Interpretation requires strong clinical reasoning skills [[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching.md]].
- Correlation between identified "dysfunction" and pain/injury is not always direct [[IX-7. Pain Science in Exercise & Rehabilitation]].
- Focus should remain on improving meaningful function and resilience, not just achieving "perfect" movement according to a specific model.
