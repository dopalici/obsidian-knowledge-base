### **EXL-56: Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)**

**ID:** EXL-56-MEX-LATPD-WIDE **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based exercise [[B10. Machine Training]] simulating a wide-grip pull-up, involving pulling a wide bar down towards the upper chest while seated. Primarily targets the latissimus dorsi, promoting back width.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Grip Width/Type (Close Grip, Neutral Grip [[EXL-57 Seated Row (Machine - Close GripNeutral)]] - (Note: EXL-57 is Seated Row, different movement but related grip concept), Underhand Grip - alters muscle emphasis).
- Progress towards Bodyweight Pull-ups [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Assisted Pull-up Machine [[EXL-65 Assisted Pull-upDip Machine]].
- Band Assisted Pull-ups [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Seated Cable Rows [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]]

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle and Lower), Posterior Deltoid.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust knee pad to secure legs firmly. Sit facing machine, grasp wide bar with overhand (pronated) grip significantly wider than shoulder-width. Maintain upright torso, potentially slight lean back from hips (~10-15 degrees), keep chest up. Depress and slightly retract scapulae to initiate.
- **Execution:** Inhale slightly. Exhale while pulling the bar down towards the upper chest (clavicle area), leading with the elbows. Focus on driving elbows down and back, squeezing shoulder blades together and down at the bottom. Avoid excessive leaning back or using momentum. Control the ascent (eccentric phase), allowing lats to stretch fully at the top while maintaining slight tension. Allow scapulae to upwardly rotate/elevate at the top before initiating next rep by depressing them.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during controlled ascent (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum/body swing, rounding shoulders forward, pulling bar too low (towards stomach) or behind neck (higher risk), insufficient range of motion, shrugging shoulders upwards.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Pulling behind the neck is generally discouraged due to increased shoulder joint stress.
- **Safety:** Ensure seat/knee pad is adjusted correctly. Control the weight throughout the movement; avoid letting stack crash. Start with lighter weight to master form and scapular control.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (scapular control, ROM, lack of momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
