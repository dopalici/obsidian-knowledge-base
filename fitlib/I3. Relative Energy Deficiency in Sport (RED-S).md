### I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)
**ID:** I3-ENERGY-AVAILABILITY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) is a syndrome resulting from low energy availability (LEA), where dietary energy intake is insufficient to cover the energy expended in exercise *plus* the energy required for basal physiological functions. LEA impairs numerous body systems, negatively impacting both health and performance. It affects both male and female athletes.

**Cause:** Mismatch between energy intake (EI) and total energy expenditure (TEE). Energy Availability (EA) = (EI - EEE) / FFM. LEA occurs when EA falls below optimal levels (generally <30-35 kcal/kg FFM/day, optimal may be ~45 kcal/kg FFM/day). Can be intentional or unintentional.

**Physiological Consequences (Multi-System Effects):**
- **Endocrine/Reproductive:** Menstrual dysfunction/low estrogen (females), reduced testosterone (males), altered thyroid/cortisol/GH/IGF-1.
- **Bone Health:** Impaired bone formation, reduced BMD, increased stress fracture risk.
- **Metabolic:** Decreased RMR ([[C8. Metabolic Adaptation (Adaptive Thermogenesis)]]).
- **Hematological:** Potential iron deficiency.
- **Growth & Development:** Impaired in adolescents.
- **Cardiovascular:** Potential negative changes.
- **Gastrointestinal:** Potential issues.
- **Immunological:** Suppressed immune function.
- **Psychological:** Increased risk of depression, anxiety, disordered eating.

**Performance Consequences:** Decreased endurance, strength, power; impaired training response; decreased coordination/concentration; increased injury risk; impaired glycogen storage.

**Risk Factors:** Sports emphasizing leanness, high training volume, dieting/disordered eating, lack of nutritional knowledge, psychological stress.

**Diagnosis & Management:** Multidisciplinary approach (MD, RD, Psychologist). Based on clinical signs, dietary assessment, testing. Management involves increasing EA (↑intake / ↓expenditure), addressing deficiencies, psychological support, modifying training.
