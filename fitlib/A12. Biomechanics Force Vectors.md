\*\*Created:\*\* 2025-04-23

Force is a push or pull that can cause acceleration (change in motion). In biomechanics, forces are represented as vectors, having both magnitude (size) and direction.

\- \*\*Types of Forces:\*\* Gravity, muscle contraction force, ground reaction force, friction, joint reaction forces.  
\- \*\*Vector Representation:\*\* Arrow indicating direction, length indicating magnitude.  
\- \*\*Force Components:\*\* Forces can be resolved into perpendicular components (e.g., rotary component causing rotation, stabilizing/destabilizing component acting along the bone).  
\- \*\*Muscle Line of Pull:\*\* The direction of force exerted by a muscle, determined by its origin, insertion, and joint position. Changes throughout ROM.  
\- \*\*Resultant Force:\*\* The net effect when multiple forces act on an object/body segment. Calculated using vector addition.

\*\*Implications:\*\* Understanding force vectors is crucial for analyzing joint stress, muscle function during exercises, and optimizing technique to apply force effectively (e.g., aligning muscle force with desired movement direction).
