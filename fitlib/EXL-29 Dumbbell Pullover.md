### **EXL-29: Dumbbell Pullover**

**ID:** EXL-29-DB-PULLOVER **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An exercise performed lying typically crosswise on a bench, lowering a single dumbbell held with both hands behind the head and pulling it back over the chest. Targets primarily the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major, also involves serratus and triceps long head.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good shoulder mobility and control).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], pause at stretch).
- Barbell Pullover (different grip/feel).
- Cable Pullover (standing or lying - constant tension).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Reduce Range of Motion (don't lower dumbbell as far back).
- Perform lying lengthwise on bench for more stability.
- Straight-Arm Lat Pulldown (similar motion pattern with cables) [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]].
- Focus on improving shoulder flexion mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Pectoralis Major (sternal head).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Teres Major, Serratus Anterior, Triceps Brachii (long head - assists shoulder extension), Rhomboids, Posterior Deltoid.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (resisting rib flare/back arch), Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie perpendicular across a flat bench with only upper back/shoulders supported, feet flat on floor, hips lower than bench. Hold one dumbbell vertically with both hands, cupping the top end with palms forming a diamond shape (or holding the handle). Start with dumbbell directly over chest, elbows slightly bent.
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower the dumbbell backward over the head in a wide arc, keeping elbows slightly bent. Lower as far as shoulder mobility allows comfortably while maintaining core stability and preventing excessive rib flare or lower back arching. Feel a stretch in lats/chest. Exhale and pull the dumbbell back over the chest using the same arc, focusing on contracting lats and chest.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering/stretch phase, exhale during pulling/concentric phase.
- **Common Faults:** Bending elbows too much (turning it into triceps extension), excessive arching of lower back/rib flare, insufficient range of motion, losing core control.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Shoulder impingement or instability, limited shoulder flexion mobility. Can aggravate shoulder issues if performed incorrectly or through painful ROM. Requires careful execution to protect shoulder joint.
- **Safety:** Ensure stable position on bench. Control the weight throughout. Use appropriate weight that allows good form and controlled stretch. Avoid forcing range of motion beyond comfortable limits.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable torso, minimal elbow bend change) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
