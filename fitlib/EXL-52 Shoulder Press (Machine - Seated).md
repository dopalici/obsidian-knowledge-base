### **EXL-52: Shoulder Press (Machine - Seated)**

**ID:** EXL-52-MEX-SHOULDERPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based exercise [[B10. Machine Training]] simulating an overhead press, performed seated, involving pressing handles vertically upwards. Provides stability and targets the deltoids and triceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Machine Press.
- Progress to Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]] or Standing Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Shoulder Press [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Pike Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Focus on Lateral/Front Raises [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]], [[EXL-25 Dumbbell Front Raise]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid, Medial Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Upper Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Serratus Anterior, Trapezius (upper and middle).
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so handles start at approximately shoulder level. Sit with back firmly against pad, feet flat on floor. Grip handles (pronated or neutral grip depending on machine). Maintain upright posture, core engaged.
- **Execution:** Exhale and press handles vertically overhead until arms are fully extended (avoid forceful lockout). Focus on using shoulder and triceps muscles. Keep head neutral, back against pad. Inhale and slowly lower handles back to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during press (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Arching lower back excessively off pad, shrugging shoulders, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled lowering phase.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff). Fixed path may cause discomfort for some individuals.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat adjustment. Control the weight. Avoid slamming stack. Maintain good posture.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, posture, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
