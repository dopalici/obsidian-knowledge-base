### **EXL-03: Barbell Conventional Deadlift**

**ID:** EXL-03-BB-DEADLIFT **Created:** 2025-04-28

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental compound exercise involving lifting a loaded barbell off the floor from a hip-hinged position until standing upright with hips and knees locked out. Develops strength and hypertrophy in the entire posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, spinal erectors), legs, back, and grip.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires high degree of technical proficiency, mobility, and core stability to perform safely and effectively).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]] (often lower reps for max strength).
- Variations: Deficit Deadlifts, Paused Deadlifts, Rack Pulls (shorter ROM).
- Sumo Deadlift [[EXL-04 Barbell Sumo Deadlift]].
- Improve Grip Strength.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs) [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].
- Kettlebell Deadlifts/Swings [[B9. Kettlebell Training]].
- Hex/Trap Bar Deadlifts (often easier on back).
- Hip Thrusts [[EXL-07 Barbell Hip Thrust]].
- Improve hip hinge mechanics [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] & core stability [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings, Quadriceps (initial drive), Erector Spinae (isometric).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Latissimus Dorsi (bar path control), Trapezius, Rhomboids.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature, Forearm flexors (grip), Calves. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand mid-foot under bar, feet hip-width. Hinge at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]], bend knees to grip bar just outside shins (double overhand or mixed grip). Shins near bar. Maintain neutral spine. Chest up, shoulders slightly over bar. Pull slack out, engage lats. Brace core (Valsalva).
- **Execution:** Drive through feet ("push floor away"), extending hips/knees simultaneously. Maintain neutral spine. Keep bar close, dragging up legs. Drive hips forward forcefully past knees. Finish tall, hips/knees locked, shoulders back (no hyperextension). Lower under control: hinge hips first, then bend knees.
- **Breathing:** Deep inhale and brace before pull, hold during lift, exhale at top or during controlled descent.
- **Common Faults:** Rounding lower back, pulling with back first, hips rising too fast, bar drifting away, hyperextending at lockout, jerking bar, incomplete lockout.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injury (disc herniation, severe strain), severe spinal conditions. Requires excellent form. Not for beginners without coaching [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Master hip hinge first. Prioritize neutral spine. Control eccentric. Avoid jerky motions. Use flat, stable footwear.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load lifted for specified reps/sets.
- Bar velocity.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (spinal position, bar path).
