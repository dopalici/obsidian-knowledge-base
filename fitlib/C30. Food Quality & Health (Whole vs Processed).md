**ID:** C30-FOOD-QUALITY **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Food quality refers to the overall healthfulness of foods beyond their basic macronutrient profile, considering nutrient density, degree of processing, and potential health impacts. Prioritizing whole, minimally processed foods forms the foundation of healthy dietary patterns [].

**Food Processing Spectrum (e.g., NOVA Classification):**

- **Group 1: Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods:** Edible parts of plants (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes) or animals (meat, fish, eggs, milk) with minimal alteration (e.g., washing, cutting, drying, freezing, pasteurizing). Retain most of their inherent nutritional value. Examples: Fresh fruit, vegetables, plain yogurt, brown rice, dried beans, fresh meat.
- **Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients:** Substances extracted from Group 1 foods or nature (oils, fats, sugar, salt, flours, starches). Used to prepare Group 1 foods.
- **Group 3: Processed Foods:** Relatively simple products made by adding Group 2 ingredients to Group 1 foods, primarily to increase durability or modify palatability. Examples: Canned vegetables/fish, simple breads, cheeses.
- **Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs):** Industrial formulations typically made from substances extracted from foods (e.g., fats, starches, added sugars, protein isolates) or synthesized in labs (e.g., artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers). Often contain little or no intact Group 1 foods. Characterized by high palatability, convenience, aggressive marketing, and low cost. Examples: Sugary drinks, packaged snacks/cookies, confectionery, instant noodles/soups, processed meats, many ready-to-eat meals [].

**Why Prioritize Whole/Minimally Processed Foods?**

- **Higher Nutrient Density:** Generally richer in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients per calorie compared to UPFs [[A4. Micronutrients]], [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
- **Greater Satiety:** Higher fiber and often protein content can lead to increased feelings of fullness, aiding energy regulation [[A1. Energy Balance]].
- **Better Gut Health:** Provides fiber and prebiotics essential for a diverse and healthy gut microbiome [[C32. Gut Health and Microbiome]].
- **Reduced Chronic Disease Risk:** Diets high in whole foods are consistently linked to lower risks of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and overall mortality [[C10. Mediterranean Diet]], [[C11. Vegetarian & Vegan Diets]].
- **Better Glycemic Control:** Fiber slows carbohydrate digestion and absorption [[A3. Macronutrients]].

**Concerns with High UPF Intake:**

- Epidemiological studies consistently associate high UPF consumption with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and all-cause mortality [].
- Mechanisms may include: higher energy density, lower satiety potential (leading to passive overconsumption), adverse effects on gut microbiome, impact of specific additives, displacement of nutrient-dense whole foods [].

**Practical Application:**

- Build dietary patterns primarily around Group 1 foods.
- Use Group 2 ingredients for cooking/preparing Group 1 foods.
- Limit consumption of Group 3 foods.
- Minimize consumption of Group 4 (UPFs).
- Reading labels [[C31. Reading Nutrition Labels]] helps identify degree of processing and ingredients.
- Even within flexible dieting approaches [[C18. Flexible Dieting (IIFYM - If It Fits Your Macros)]], prioritize meeting macro targets predominantly through nutrient-dense, minimally processed options.
