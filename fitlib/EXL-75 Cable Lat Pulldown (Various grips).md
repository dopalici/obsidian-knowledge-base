### **EXL-75: Cable Lat Pulldown (Various grips)**

**ID:** EXL-75-CEX-LATPD-VARIOUS _(Note: Similar to EXL-56 but emphasizing cable variation)_ **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A vertical pulling exercise using a high pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] and various grip attachments (wide bar, close grip V-bar, neutral grip handles, single D-handle) to target the latissimus dorsi and other back muscles. Provides constant tension.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Grip Attachment/Width (Wide Pronated [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]]; Close Neutral; Underhand; Single Arm - alters emphasis and stability demands).
- Progress towards Bodyweight Pull-ups [[EXL-81 Pull-up  Chin-up (Bodyweight)]].
- Use Assisted Pull-up Machine [[EXL-65 Assisted Pull-upDip Machine]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Band Assisted Pull-ups [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Seated Rows  [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]] 

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Latissimus Dorsi, Teres Major. (Emphasis shifts slightly with grip).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle and Lower), Posterior Deltoid.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach desired handle to high pulley cable. Adjust knee pad to secure legs firmly. Sit facing machine, grasp handle(s). Maintain upright torso, potentially slight lean back, chest up. Depress and slightly retract scapulae to initiate.
- **Execution:** Inhale slightly. Exhale while pulling the handle(s) down towards the upper chest, leading with elbows. Drive elbows down and back, squeezing shoulder blades together and down at bottom. Avoid excessive leaning back or momentum. Control the ascent (eccentric phase), allowing lats to stretch fully at top. Allow scapulae to upwardly rotate/elevate before initiating next rep by depressing them.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during controlled ascent (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using excessive momentum/swing, rounding shoulders forward, pulling bar too low or behind neck, insufficient ROM, shrugging.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Behind-the-neck variations generally discouraged due to shoulder stress.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper setup. Control weight. Initiate with scapulae. Avoid excessive momentum.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (scapular control, ROM, minimal momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
