**ID:** C24-ERGOGENIC-AIDS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Ergogenic aids refer broadly to any substance, technique, or device used with the intention of enhancing physical performance, energy production, use, or recovery [].

**Categories:**

- **Nutritional:** Supplements or specific dietary strategies aimed at improving performance (e.g., creatine, caffeine, beta-alanine, nitrate, bicarbonate, carbohydrate loading). See [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]], [[C22. Supplements with LimitedMixed Evidence (Group B)]], [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]].
- **Pharmacological:** Drugs or medications used illicitly to enhance performance (e.g., anabolic steroids, EPO, growth hormone, stimulants). These are typically banned in sports and carry significant health risks [[P2. Performance Enhancement Ethics]].
- **Physiological:** Methods manipulating bodily functions (e.g., blood doping, altitude training, cooling strategies). Some are banned (blood doping), while others are permitted (altitude training).
- **Psychological:** Mental techniques used to enhance performance (e.g., imagery, self-talk, goal setting, arousal regulation) [[K3. Psychological Aspects of Elite Performance]].
- **Mechanical/Biomechanical:** Equipment or devices designed to improve efficiency or force production (e.g., aerodynamic bicycles, advanced running shoes, lifting belts/suits).

**Evaluation Framework:** It is crucial to evaluate any potential ergogenic aid based on scientific evidence for:

1. **Efficacy:** Does it actually work for the intended purpose in the target population/sport? [[J2. Evaluating Scientific Research in Fitness]]
2. **Safety:** What are the short-term and long-term health risks?
3. **Legality/Permissibility:** Is it allowed by relevant anti-doping agencies (e.g., WADA)? [[P2. Performance Enhancement Ethics]]
4. **Need:** Is there a genuine requirement or potential benefit beyond standard training and nutrition? [[C20. Supplements (Overview & Framework)]]

**Focus in this Library:** This library primarily focuses on **legal and evidence-based nutritional, physiological, and psychological ergogenic aids.** Pharmacological doping methods are generally discussed only in the context of ethics and anti-doping [[P2. Performance Enhancement Ethics]].
