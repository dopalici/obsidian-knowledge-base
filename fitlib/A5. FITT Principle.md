### A5. FITT Principle
**ID:** A5-FITT-PRINCIPLE
**Created:** 2025-04-23

The FITT principle provides a framework for designing exercise programs by manipulating key variables: Frequency, Intensity, Time (Duration), and Type. It helps ensure programs are structured, progressive, and meet specific goals.

- **Frequency:** How often exercise is performed (e.g., sessions per week).
- **Intensity:** How hard the exercise is performed (e.g., %1RM, RPE, Heart Rate Zone).
- **Time:** Duration of each exercise session or total time accumulated per week.
- **Type:** Mode of exercise chosen (e.g., resistance training, running, swimming).

**Application:** Used to prescribe exercise for health/fitness/performance goals. Variables are interconnected. Progression involves increasing one or more FITT variables ([[A21. Principle of Progression]]). Individualization based on goals/level/preferences ([[A23. Principle of Individuality]]).
