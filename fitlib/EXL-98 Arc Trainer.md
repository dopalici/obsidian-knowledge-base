### **EXL-98: Arc Trainer**

**ID:** EXL-98-CARDIO-ARCTRAINER **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A cardiovascular exercise machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] characterized by an arcuate (curved) footplate motion, differing from the more oval path of an elliptical [[EXL-92 Elliptical Trainer]]. It provides a low-impact, weight-bearing workout, often allowing adjustments to resistance and incline/stride pattern.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (adjustable resistance/speed/duration/incline).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Resistance Level [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Speed (Strides Per Minute).
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Incline/Stride Path setting (if available).
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]] / [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Resistance Level.
- Decrease Speed.
- Decrease Duration.
- Decrease Incline/Stride Path setting.
- Use alternative low-impact cardio (e.g., [[EXL-92 Elliptical Trainer]], [[EXL-94 Stationary Bike (Recumbent)]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves. Some models have moving arms engaging upper body (Chest, Back, Arms).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]] (General Posture)

- **Setup:** Step onto footplates, grasp handlebars (stationary or moving). Select program or manual mode.
- **Execution:** Begin moving pedals following the machine's arcuate path. Maintain upright posture, core engaged. Drive through the entire foot. If using moving handlebars, coordinate arm movement with legs. Adjust settings as desired.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing appropriate for intensity.
- **Common Faults:** Poor posture, relying heavily on handlebars, insufficient resistance or intensity.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute lower limb injuries may still be aggravated. Generally well-tolerated due to low impact. Check with physician if cardiovascular conditions exist [[Q5. Exercise Considerations for Health Conditions Overview]].
- **Safety:** Ensure stable footing when getting on/off. Start at low intensity. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Resistance Level, Speed (SPM), Incline/Stride Level (if applicable), Distance (estimated) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Power Output (Watts - if available).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
