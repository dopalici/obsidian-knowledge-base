Strength training improves running economy, power, and reduces injury risk ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]).

**Benefits:** Injury prevention, improved running economy, increased power/speed, maintained LBM.
**Key Areas:** Core ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]), Hips (Glutes/Abductors), Single-Leg Strength, Calves. Plyometrics (advanced).
**Programming:** 1-3x/week, focus on strength/power (5-12 reps), schedule to minimize interference ([[E4. Concurrent Training (Interference Effect)]]).
