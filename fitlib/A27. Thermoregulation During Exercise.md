# A27. Thermoregulation During Exercise

**ID:** A27-THERMOREGULATION

**Created:** 2025-04-25

  

Thermoregulation is the physiological process of maintaining a stable core body temperature (~37°C / 98.6°F). During exercise, increased metabolism produces significant heat, requiring effective dissipation to prevent hyperthermia.

  

**Mechanisms of Heat Loss:** Evaporation (sweating - primary during exercise, humidity dependent), Radiation, Convection, Conduction.

  

**Physiological Responses to Heat Stress:** Increased Sweating (fluid/electrolyte loss - [[C4. Hydration]], [[C5. Electrolytes]]), Increased Skin Blood Flow (vasodilation), Cardiovascular Strain (CV Drift - ↑HR to maintain Q despite ↓SV).

  

**Factors Affecting:** Environment (temp, humidity, wind, sun), intensity, hydration, clothing, acclimatization, individual factors.

  

**Heat Acclimatization:** Adaptations over ~7-14 days (↑sweat rate/dilution, ↑plasma volume, ↓core temp/HR response). Improves performance/reduces heat illness risk (related to [[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]] - Environmental factors).
