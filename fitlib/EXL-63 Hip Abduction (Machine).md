### **EXL-63: Hip Abduction (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-63-MEX-HIPABD **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]], involving pushing the legs outward against resistance pads while seated. Primarily targets the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, important for hip stability and abduction.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak abduction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Banded Hip Abduction (standing or side-lying) [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Cable Hip Abduction.
- Side Lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]].
- Side Planks with Leg Raise [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Side-Lying Hip Abduction [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Clamshells (bodyweight or banded) [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] (focus on glute max but involves stabilization).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Medius, Gluteus Minimus, Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Piriformis, Superior fibers of Gluteus Maximus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Hip Adductors (eccentric control), Quadratus Lumborum.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on machine with outer thighs/knees pressed against the inside of the pads. Adjust machine starting position/ROM if possible. Sit upright with back supported, core engaged. Grip handles for stability.
- **Execution:** Exhale and press legs outward (abduct hips) against the pads, controlling the movement through the available range of motion. Focus on contracting the outer hip/glute muscles. Pause briefly at the point of maximum abduction. Inhale and slowly return legs to the starting position under control (eccentric adduction).
- **Breathing:** Exhale during abduction (concentric), inhale during adduction (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum, incomplete range of motion, leaning forward/backward excessively, allowing torso rotation.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute hip pain/injury (e.g., bursitis, labral tear - requires careful evaluation). Use caution if experiencing IT band syndrome symptoms.
- **Safety:** Ensure machine is adjusted correctly. Use appropriate weight allowing controlled movement. Avoid slamming weights together at the start/end position.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
