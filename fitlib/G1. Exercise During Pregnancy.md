### G1. Exercise During Pregnancy
**ID:** G1-EXERCISE-PREGNANCY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Exercise during pregnancy is generally safe and recommended for most healthy women without complications, offering numerous benefits to both mother and fetus. Guidelines emphasize moderate-intensity activity and specific precautions.

**Benefits of Prenatal Exercise:**
- **Maternal:** Reduced risk of excessive gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, cesarean delivery; improved cardiovascular function, mood, sleep; potentially shorter/easier labor; faster postpartum recovery.
- **Fetal/Neonatal:** Potential benefits for fetal growth (within normal ranges), potentially improved stress tolerance, possible long-term health benefits (reduced childhood obesity risk - emerging evidence).

**Evidence-Based Guidelines (e.g., ACOG, Canadian Guideline 2019):**
- **Frequency:** Most days of the week.
- **Intensity:** Moderate intensity recommended (able to maintain conversation - "talk test"; RPE 12-14 on 6-20 scale; specific HR zones less reliable due to pregnancy-induced changes). Vigorous intensity may be appropriate for women habituated to it before pregnancy, with guidance.
- **Time:** Accumulate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Sessions can be broken up.
- **Type:** Aerobic activities (walking, swimming, stationary cycling, modified aerobics) and resistance training (using lighter weights/higher reps, avoiding Valsalva maneuver, modifying positions). Pelvic floor muscle training (Kegels) recommended.
- **Progression:** Gradual progression if previously sedentary. Maintain activity level if already active, modifying as needed.

**Contraindications & Precautions:**
- **Absolute Contraindications (Exercise Should Not Be Done):** Hemodynamically significant heart disease, restrictive lung disease, incompetent cervix, persistent 2nd/3rd trimester bleeding, placenta previa after 26 weeks, ruptured membranes, preeclampsia/pregnancy-induced hypertension. (Related to [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications]]).
- **Relative Contraindications (Consult Physician):** Severe anemia, chronic bronchitis, poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes/hypertension/thyroid disease, extreme obesity or underweight, heavy smoker.
- **Warning Signs to Stop Exercise:** Vaginal bleeding, regular painful contractions, amniotic fluid leakage, dyspnea before exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness affecting balance, calf pain/swelling.
- **Modifications:**
    - Avoid supine position after first trimester (potential vena cava compression).
    - Avoid activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma.
    - Avoid exercising in excessive heat/humidity; ensure adequate hydration ([[C4. Hydration]]).
    - Listen to body, adjust intensity/duration. Avoid overheating.
    - Ensure adequate caloric intake.
