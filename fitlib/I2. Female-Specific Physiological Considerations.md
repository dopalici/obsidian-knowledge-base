### I2. Female-Specific Physiological Considerations
**ID:** I2-FEMALE-PHYSIOLOGY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

While basic physiological principles apply to both sexes, female physiology involves unique hormonal fluctuations (menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives, menopause) and anatomical/physiological differences that can influence exercise response, performance, nutritional needs, and injury risk.

**Menstrual Cycle Influences:**
- **Hormonal Fluctuations:** Estrogen and progesterone vary across the cycle (Follicular, Ovulatory, Luteal phases).
- **Performance Effects:** Research mixed/individualized. Potential trends: slightly higher strength in late follicular/ovulatory; potentially impaired thermoregulation in mid-luteal. Substrate use may shift. Possible increased ACL injury risk around ovulation. Most women don't need drastic cycle-based training changes unless symptomatic.
- **Hormonal Contraceptives (HC):** Suppress endogenous fluctuations. May slightly blunt strength/hypertrophy gains in some studies (evidence inconsistent).

**Sex Differences in Exercise Response:**
- **Substrate Utilization:** Females tend to rely more on fat oxidation during submaximal endurance exercise.
- **Muscle Fiber Type/Fatigability:** Females may have slightly higher Type I proportion and greater fatigue resistance during some tasks.
- **Strength/Power:** Lower absolute values, similar relative gains with training.
- **Thermoregulation:** Differences exist, but overall heat tolerance similar when matched for fitness/acclimatization.

**Nutritional Considerations:**
- **Iron:** Higher requirements/risk of deficiency ([[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]]).
- **Calcium/Vitamin D:** Crucial for bone health, especially post-menopause.
- **Energy Availability:** High susceptibility to RED-S ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]), including Female Athlete Triad components.

**Pregnancy & Postpartum:** Specific physiological changes require exercise modifications ([[G1. Exercise During Pregnancy]]).

**Menopause:** Decreased estrogen accelerates bone/muscle loss, changes body composition. Exercise crucial for mitigation.
