### **EXL-45: Arnold Press**

**ID:** EXL-45-DB-ARNOLDPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A variation of the dumbbell shoulder press [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]] popularized by Arnold Schwarzenegger. It involves starting with palms facing the body and rotating the palms forward during the upward pressing motion, increasing the range of motion and potentially involving more muscle fibers.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires more coordination and control than standard dumbbell press).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow rotation, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Standing Arnold Press (increases core stability demand).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Standard Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]].
- Machine Shoulder Press [[EXL-52 Shoulder Press (Machine - Seated)]].
- Focus on separate Front Raises [[EXL-25 Dumbbell Front Raise]] and Lateral Raises [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid, Medial Deltoid, Triceps Brachii. (Rotation may increase anterior deltoid focus).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Upper Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Serratus Anterior, Trapezius (upper and middle).
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (especially if standing)..

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit on an upright bench (preferably with back support). Hold dumbbells at shoulder level with palms facing your body, elbows bent and slightly in front of torso.
- **Execution:** Exhale and begin pressing dumbbells overhead while simultaneously rotating wrists/forearms so that palms face forward at the top of the movement (similar to standard overhead press position). Press until arms are fully extended overhead but not locked out. Inhale and reverse the motion under control, rotating palms back towards body as you lower dumbbells back to starting position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during press/rotation (concentric), inhale during lowering/reverse rotation (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Performing rotation too early or too late, using momentum, excessive back arching, incomplete range of motion, unstable shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). The rotational component may aggravate some shoulder conditions. Ensure adequate shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- **Safety:** Use lighter weight than standard dumbbell press initially to master coordination. Control rotation smoothly. Ensure stable seated or standing position.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (smooth rotation, control, range of motion) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
