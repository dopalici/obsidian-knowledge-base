### **EXL-61: Calf Raise (Machine - Standing)**

**ID:** EXL-61-MEX-CALFRAISE-STAND **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) through ankle plantarflexion, performed on a standing calf raise machine [[B10. Machine Training]] which provides stability via shoulder pads.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack/Plates) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top/bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Leg Standing Machine Calf Raise.
- Progress to Barbell Calf Raise [[EXL-20 Barbell Calf Raise]] or Dumbbell Calf Raise [[EXL-42 Dumbbell Calf Raise (Standing)]] (require more balance).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Calf Raises [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Seated Calf Raise Machine [[EXL-62 Calf Raise (Machine - Seated)]] (focuses on soleus, less load typically).
- Reduce Range of Motion initially.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gastrocnemius (emphasized with knee straight), Soleus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Tibialis Posterior, Peroneus Longus/Brevis, Flexor Hallucis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Longus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (to maintain posture under pads).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Position shoulders under pads, adjusting height so you can stand fully upright with knees straight (slight bend okay). Place balls of feet firmly on edge of platform, heels hanging off. Maintain upright posture, core engaged.
- **Execution:** Lower heels towards floor slowly, feeling a stretch in the calves (eccentric phase). Pause briefly at the bottom. Push forcefully through the balls of the feet to raise heels as high as possible (plantarflexion), achieving peak contraction. Squeeze calves at the top. Control the descent back to the stretched position.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during heel raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Bouncing at the bottom, incomplete range of motion (not full stretch or peak contraction), bending knees excessively (shifts focus), using momentum.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute ankle sprains, Achilles tendinopathy/rupture (requires careful management), plantar fasciitis (may be aggravated by stretch).
- **Safety:** Ensure proper pad height adjustment. Control the movement throughout the full ROM. Avoid bouncing. Keep knees relatively straight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, knee position) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
