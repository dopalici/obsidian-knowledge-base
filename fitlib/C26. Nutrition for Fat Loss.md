Nutrition strategies for fat loss centre on creating a sustained negative energy balance (caloric deficit) while prioritizing the preservation of lean body mass (LBM), managing hunger, and maintaining overall health and performance capacity [[D1. Evidence-Based Weight Loss Principles]].

**Key Nutritional Requirements:**

1. **Consistent Energy Deficit:** Non-negotiable for fat loss [[A1. Energy Balance]]. A moderate deficit of **~10-25% below TDEE**, or approximately 500-750 kcal/day, is typically recommended. This generally supports a sustainable rate of weight loss (~0.5-1.0% of body weight per week) while minimizing LBM loss and severe metabolic adaptation [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]], [[H3. Realistic Fat Loss Rates]], [[C8. Metabolic Adaptation (Adaptive Thermogenesis)]]. More aggressive deficits may be tolerated initially by individuals with higher body fat but increase risks for leaner individuals [].
2. **High Protein Intake:** Crucial for preserving LBM during calorie restriction. Also enhances satiety and has the highest thermic effect of food (TEF). Target **~1.8-2.7 g/kg body weight per day**, or even higher based on fat-free mass for lean individuals in significant deficits [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]], [[C16. High-Protein Diets]].
3. **Adequate Fiber Intake:** Promotes satiety, supports digestive health [[C32. Gut Health and Microbiome]]. Aim for ≥14g per 1000 kcal or ≥25-38g/day from whole foods (vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains) [[A3. Macronutrients]].
4. **Sufficient Fat Intake:** Ensure adequate intake (≥20% of calories or ~0.5-0.6 g/kg) for hormone production and essential fatty acids [[A3. Macronutrients]]. Prioritize unsaturated fats.
5. **Strategic Carbohydrate Intake:** Adjusted based on remaining calories after protein/fat needs are met. Prioritize complex, high-fiber sources. Timing around workouts [[C3. Nutrient Timing]] can help support training performance despite the deficit. Low-carbohydrate approaches can be effective if preferred and sustainable [[C15. Low-Carb Diets (General)]].
6. **Focus on Food Quality & Nutrient Density:** Emphasize whole, minimally processed foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]] to maximize satiety and ensure adequate micronutrient intake [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]] within a reduced calorie budget.
7. **Adequate Hydration:** Supports metabolism and can help manage hunger cues [[C4. Hydration]].

**Role of Resistance Training:** Essential during fat loss to provide the stimulus needed to retain LBM [[B. Resistance Training]].
