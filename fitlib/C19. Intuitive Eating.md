**ID:** C19-INTUITIVE-EATING **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Intuitive Eating (IE) is a self-care eating framework integrating instinct, emotion, and rational thought, developed by dietitians Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch. It is a weight-neutral model focused on rejecting the diet mentality, honoring internal hunger and fullness cues, and cultivating a healthy relationship with food and body image [].

**Core Principles (10 Principles):**

1. **Reject the Diet Mentality:** Letting go of the belief in dieting for weight control and the hope for quick fixes.
2. **Honor Your Hunger:** Responding to early biological hunger cues to build trust with oneself and food.
3. **Make Peace with Food:** Giving unconditional permission to eat all foods without guilt or moral judgment.
4. **Challenge the Food Police:** Silencing the internal critical voices that dictate "good" and "bad" food choices.
5. **Discover the Satisfaction Factor:** Finding pleasure and contentment in the eating experience.
6. **Feel Your Fullness:** Tuning into body signals that indicate comfortable satiety and pausing mid-meal to assess hunger/fullness.
7. **Cope with Your Emotions with Kindness:** Finding non-food coping mechanisms for feelings like anxiety, boredom, or stress [[M3. Stress Management and Performance]].
8. **Respect Your Body:** Accepting one's genetic blueprint and treating the body with dignity, regardless of shape or size [[P3. Body Image and Fitness Culture]].
9. **Movement—Feel the Difference:** Focusing on the enjoyable aspects of physical activity rather than calorie burning or body shaping.
10. **Honor Your Health—Gentle Nutrition:** Making food choices that honor health and taste buds while promoting well-being, without rigidity or perfectionism.

**Key Focus & Outcomes:**

- Emphasizes interoceptive awareness (attunement to internal body cues).
- Promotes body appreciation and acceptance.
- Aims to reduce disordered eating patterns, food preoccupation, and weight cycling.
- Associated with improved psychological well-being (higher self-esteem, lower depression/anxiety) and potentially better biomarkers (e.g., lipids, blood pressure), independent of weight change [].

**Fitness & Performance Considerations:**

- **Weight-Neutral Approach:** Weight loss is not a goal of IE, though it may occur as a side effect for some individuals healing their relationship with food. May not align with intentional weight manipulation goals required for certain physique or weight-class sports.
- **Performance Nutrition:** Experienced intuitive eaters can integrate gentle nutrition principles to fuel performance [[O3. Integrating Nutrition and Training]], but it requires significant attunement and may be less precise than structured plans for elite athletes with very specific fueling needs (e.g., precise carbohydrate loading [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]).
- **Potential Challenges:** May be difficult for individuals disconnected from internal cues due to chronic dieting or those needing structured dietary therapy for medical conditions. Requires unlearning external diet rules.
