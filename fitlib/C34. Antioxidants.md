\*\*Created:\*\* 2025-04-23

Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation, a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species \- ROS), thereby preventing or delaying damage to cells. Exercise increases ROS production, which plays a dual role: contributing to fatigue/damage but also acting as crucial signaling molecules for training adaptations.

\*\*Sources:\*\*  
\- \*\*Endogenous:\*\* Produced by the body (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase). Exercise training enhances endogenous antioxidant capacity.  
\- \*\*Exogenous (Dietary):\*\* Obtained from food, primarily plant-based sources.  
    \- \*Vitamins:\* Vitamin C, Vitamin E ([[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]]).  
    \- \*Minerals:\* Selenium, Zinc, Copper, Manganese (cofactors for antioxidant enzymes).  
    \- \*Phytonutrients/Polyphenols:\* Flavonoids (berries, tea, cocoa), Carotenoids (carrots, sweet potatoes), Resveratrol (grapes), Curcumin (turmeric), etc. Found abundantly in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices.

\*\*Role in Exercise:\*\*  
\- \*\*ROS Production:\*\* Exercise (muscle contraction, increased metabolism) generates ROS.  
\- \*\*Dual Role of ROS:\*\*  
    \- \*Negative:\* High levels contribute to muscle fatigue and exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD).  
    \- \*Positive:\* Act as essential signaling molecules stimulating adaptations to training (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1alpha, insulin sensitivity improvements, endogenous antioxidant enzyme upregulation).  
\- \*\*Antioxidant Defense:\*\* Body's endogenous system and dietary antioxidants counteract excessive ROS damage.

\*\*Supplementation vs. Whole Foods:\*\*  
\- \*\*Whole Foods:\*\* Consuming a diet rich in antioxidant-containing whole foods supports overall health and provides a balanced array of compounds. Generally recommended approach.  
\- \*\*High-Dose Supplementation:\*\* Supplementing with high doses of isolated antioxidants (esp. Vitamin C, E) around training time has shown potential to \*blunt\* beneficial training adaptations by interfering with ROS signaling pathways (\[Merry & Ristow, 2016; Paulsen et al., 2014\]). May reduce DOMS slightly but potentially at the cost of long-term adaptation. Generally not recommended for healthy, exercising individuals unless specific deficiency exists.
