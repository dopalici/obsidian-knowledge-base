Swimming training focuses on developing stroke technique/efficiency, cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance (particularly upper body and core), and race-specific pacing across various distances and strokes.

**Physiological Demands:** Full-body workout demanding high aerobic capacity ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]), significant muscular endurance, and anaerobic power for sprints. Technique/efficiency heavily impacts energy cost. Core strength crucial for streamlining and power transfer ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]).

**Biomechanical Considerations:**
- **Technique:** Primary determinant of speed/efficiency. Focus on Streamlining, Propulsion (Pull/Catch, Kick), Body Roll, Timing/Coordination. High Elbow Catch/EVF emphasized.
- **Stroke Specifics:** Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly have unique requirements.

**Training Components:**
- **Technique Work/Drills:** Essential component using specific drills.
- **Endurance/Aerobic Base:** Longer swims or sets with short rest at moderate intensity ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]).
- **Threshold Training:** Sets at or near lactate threshold pace ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]).
- **VO2 Max / Aerobic Power:** High-intensity intervals.
- **Sprint/Anaerobic Training:** Short, maximal effort swims.
- **Pacing Practice:** Sets designed for race pace.
- **Dry-Land Training:** Crucial for force production, core stability, shoulder health/injury prevention ([[X3.1. Dry-Land Training for Swimmers]]). Focus on pulling strength, shoulder stability, core, leg power, mobility ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).

**Nutrition & Hydration:** High energy demands. Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake. Hydration important despite being in water.

**Common Injuries:** Swimmer's shoulder (rotator cuff/impingement), breaststroker's knee, lower back pain. Often related to technique errors, overuse, inadequate dry-land conditioning/mobility.
