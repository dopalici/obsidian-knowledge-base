**ID:** C16-HIGH-PROTEIN-DIETS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

High-protein diets (HPDs) are characterized by protein intake exceeding typical recommendations or constituting a higher percentage of total calories (e.g., >1.6 g/kg/day or >25-30% of energy). They are frequently utilized to optimize body composition, support athletic training adaptations, and aid in weight management [].

**Defining "High Protein":**

- Often considered relative to standard recommendations (e.g., RDA of 0.8 g/kg) or typical intakes.
- For active individuals/athletes, "high" often refers to the upper end or exceeding the optimal range of 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]].
- Some research investigates intakes up to 3.0-3.4 g/kg/day or higher.

**Evidence-Based Benefits & Rationale:**

- **Enhanced Satiety:** Protein is the most satiating macronutrient, potentially reducing overall calorie intake and improving appetite control, particularly beneficial during weight loss phases [[D1. Evidence-Based Weight Loss Principles]].
- **Increased Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** Protein requires more energy to digest, absorb, and metabolize (~20-30% of its calories) compared to carbohydrates (~5-10%) or fats (~0-3%), contributing slightly to TDEE [[A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)]].
- **Preservation/Accretion of Lean Body Mass (LBM):**
    - Crucial for preserving muscle mass during caloric restriction [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]]. Intakes of 1.8-2.7 g/kg (or higher based on FFM for leaner individuals) are recommended [].
    - Essential for maximizing muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and hypertrophy when combined with resistance training [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]]. Optimal range typically 1.6-2.2 g/kg.
- **Improved Body Composition:** HPDs, especially when combined with exercise, are consistently associated with favorable body composition outcomes (greater fat loss, better LBM retention/gain) compared to lower-protein diets of equal calories [].

**Safety & Considerations:**

- **Kidney Health:** Extensive research indicates that HPDs do **not** cause kidney damage in _healthy individuals_ with normal kidney function. Individuals with pre-existing kidney disease should consult their physician regarding appropriate protein intake [].
- **Bone Health:** Evidence does not support claims of HPDs negatively impacting bone health. Adequate protein is necessary for bone structure and calcium homeostasis.
- **Upper Limits:** While intakes up to ~2.2 g/kg show clear benefits for active individuals, evidence for significant _additional_ benefit from extremely high intakes (e.g., >3.0-3.4 g/kg) on muscle gain or performance is less convincing and may offer diminishing returns, although they appear safe in resistance-trained individuals [].
- **Practicality:** Requires conscious effort to incorporate sufficient protein sources at most meals. Can potentially displace other nutrient-dense foods if not well-planned.

**Implementation:** Prioritize high-quality protein sources (lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, soy products, protein supplements) distributed throughout the day [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
