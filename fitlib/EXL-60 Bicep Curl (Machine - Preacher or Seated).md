### **EXL-60: Bicep Curl (Machine - Preacher or Seated)**

**ID:** EXL-60-MEX-BICEPCURL **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] targeting the elbow flexors (biceps, brachialis). Machines typically involve seated curls or preacher curls (where the upper arm is braced against a pad).

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Variations (if machine allows).
- Progress to free weight curls: Dumbbell Curls [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]], [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]], [[EXL-31 Dumbbell Hammer Curl]], [[EXL-32 Dumbbell Concentration Curl]], [[EXL-33 Dumbbell Incline Curl]].
- Barbell Curls [[EXL-14 Barbell Bicep Curl]].
- Cable Curls [[EXL-69 Cable Bicep Curl (BarHandles)]]
**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Bicep Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pulling exercises (Rows, Pulldowns/Pull-ups).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (seated), Muscles stabilizing shoulder girdle. Bracing pad in preacher curl provides upper arm stability.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Preacher Curl Example):** Adjust seat height so armpits fit snugly near top of pad. Rest back of upper arms fully on pad. Grasp handles with underhand (supinated) grip. Start with arms nearly fully extended.
- **Setup (Seated Curl Example):** Adjust seat, sit securely. Grasp handles. Start with arms extended.
- **Execution:** Exhale and curl handles upwards towards shoulders by flexing elbows. Keep upper arms stationary (braced on pad for preacher curl). Focus on contracting biceps. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly lower handles back to starting position under control, achieving full or near-full elbow extension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum, lifting upper arms off pad (preacher curl), incomplete range of motion (especially extension), uncontrolled eccentric phase.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries. Preacher curl position can place extra stress on biceps tendon at full extension if not controlled.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper machine setup/adjustment. Control the weight throughout the movement. Avoid hyperextending elbows at the bottom.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, stable upper arms) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
