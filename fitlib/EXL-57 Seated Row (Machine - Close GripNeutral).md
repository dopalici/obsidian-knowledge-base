### **EXL-57: Seated Row (Machine - Close Grip/Neutral)**

**ID:** EXL-57-MEX-ROW-SEATEDCLOSE **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based exercise [[B10. Machine Training]], typically performed seated with chest support, involving pulling a close-grip or neutral-grip handle towards the torso. Emphasizes the mid-back muscles (rhomboids, mid-traps) and lats.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Strong peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Handle/Grip (Wide grip, Single handles - alters muscle emphasis).
- Seated Cable Row  [[EXL-74 Cable Seated Row (Various grips)]].
- Progress to unsupported rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Rows [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on scapular retraction exercises.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle), Latissimus Dorsi.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Teres Major, Posterior Deltoid, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff. Chest support reduces stabilizer demand compared to free weight rows.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so chest is supported firmly on pad and arms can fully extend towards handles. Grasp close or neutral grip handle. Sit upright against pad, feet planted. Allow shoulders to protract slightly at start.
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by retracting scapulae (pinch shoulder blades together). Exhale and pull handle towards lower chest/upper abdomen, driving elbows back close to body. Focus on squeezing mid-back muscles. Pause at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly return handle to starting position under control, allowing arms and scapulae to move forward into a stretch.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Shrugging shoulders, using excessive momentum/body English (if chest not supported), incomplete range of motion (especially scapular retraction/protraction), pulling primarily with arms.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Chest support makes it generally safe for lower back.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat/pad adjustment. Control the weight throughout. Focus on initiating with scapular retraction.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (scapular movement, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
