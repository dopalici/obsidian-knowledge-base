### **EXL-08: Barbell Front Squat** 

**ID:** EXL-08-BB-FRONTSQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A squat variation where the barbell is held across the front of the shoulders (anterior deltoids) instead of the upper back. This necessitates a more upright torso position and places greater emphasis on the quadriceps and upper back/core stability.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires significant wrist/shoulder/thoracic mobility, core strength, and technical proficiency).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused Front Squats, Slow Eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Zercher Squat [[EXL-19 Zercher Squat]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Goblet Squat [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]] (Mimics upright torso, easier grip).
- Bodyweight Squat [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Improve Wrist/Shoulder/Thoracic Mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- Improve Core Strength/Bracing [[L4. Core Stability Training]].
- Practice with empty bar or lighter weight focusing on rack position.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps (highly emphasized), Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Hamstrings.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae (especially upper back for maintaining shelf), Core Musculature (Abdominals, Obliques - resisting forward flexion), Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Approach bar in rack set slightly lower than for back squat. Position bar across anterior deltoids, close to neck. Grip bar with either:
    - **Clean Grip:** Fingertips under bar (requires wrist/shoulder mobility), elbows high and parallel to floor.
    - **Cross-Arm Grip:** Arms crossed, hands resting on opposite shoulders or top of bar (less stable but easier mobility-wise).
- Unrack bar, take stable stance (typically hip-to-shoulder width, toes slightly out). Keep elbows high throughout lift to maintain bar shelf. Maintain upright torso. Brace core tightly.
- **Execution:** Inhale, brace. Descend by breaking at hips and knees simultaneously, maintaining upright torso (avoid leaning forward excessively). Keep elbows high. Track knees over toes. Descend to full depth (hip crease below knee). Drive up vertically through mid-foot, leading with chest/elbows, extending hips and knees. Keep elbows high until bar is reracked.
- **Breathing:** Deep inhale and brace before descent, hold or forcefully exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Elbows dropping (causes bar to roll off shoulders), rounding upper back, excessive forward lean, wrist pain (clean grip), insufficient depth, losing core brace.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Significant wrist, elbow, or shoulder mobility limitations. Acute shoulder or back injuries. Thoracic spine restrictions [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]]. Requires excellent technique to avoid undue stress.
- **Safety:** Master rack position first. Use safety bars in rack. Practice bailing safely (dumping bar forward). Prioritize keeping elbows high. Start light.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load lifted for specified reps/sets.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (elbow height, torso angle, depth, stability).
