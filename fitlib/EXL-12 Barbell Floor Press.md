### **EXL-12: Barbell Floor Press**

**ID:** EXL-12-BB-FLOORPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A bench press variation performed lying on the floor. The limited range of motion (upper arms stop at floor) reduces shoulder stress and emphasizes lockout strength, primarily targeting the triceps and chest.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at bottom/triceps on floor, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Close-Grip Floor Press (more triceps emphasis).
- Progress to full range Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]] or [[EXL-11 Barbell Incline Bench Press]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Floor Press [[EXL-44 Dumbbell Floor Press]].
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Machine Chest Press [[EXL-51 Chest Press (Machine - Seated)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii, Pectoralis Major (mid/lower range emphasized less due to ROM), Anterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Medial Deltoid, Serratus Anterior.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Glutes (often bridged position). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie flat on floor (can place mat underneath). Knees bent, feet flat on floor (sometimes performed with legs straight or in bridged position). Grip barbell slightly narrower than standard bench press grip (often shoulder-width or slightly wider). Have a spotter hand off the bar or set up inside a power rack with low safety pins allowing you to slide under and unrack. Bar starts above chest. Scapulae retracted and stable against floor.
- **Execution:** Inhale, lower bar under control towards mid-to-lower chest. Allow upper arms (triceps) to rest briefly on floor at bottom (full stop or light touch). Keep elbows tucked (~45 degrees). Exhale and press bar vertically upwards, focusing on triceps extension for lockout. Maintain stable body position.
- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Bouncing elbows off floor, flaring elbows excessively, unstable shoulder position, insufficient control.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or shoulder injuries. May be better tolerated than full ROM bench press for individuals with shoulder issues due to reduced stretch [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Requires careful setup to get bar into position (spotter or low rack pins highly recommended). Control the weight. Be aware of surroundings.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (control, elbow position, lockout strength).
