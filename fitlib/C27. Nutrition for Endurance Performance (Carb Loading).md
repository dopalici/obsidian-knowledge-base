Nutrition for endurance athletes focuses on optimizing fuel availability (primarily carbohydrate), maintaining hydration, preventing gastrointestinal distress, and supporting recovery to sustain performance over prolonged durations [[E. Cardiovascular  Endurance Training]].

**Key Nutritional Strategies:**

1. **High Carbohydrate Availability:** Crucial for moderate-to-high intensity endurance exercise lasting >90 minutes. Daily intake must match training load:
    - Moderate duration/low intensity: 5-7 g/kg/day
    - Moderate-heavy endurance (1-3h/day): 6-10 g/kg/day
    - Extreme exercise (>4-5h/day): 8-12 g/kg/day []. See [[A3. Macronutrients]].
2. **Carbohydrate Loading (Supercompensation):** Strategy to maximize muscle glycogen stores before major competitions lasting >90 minutes. Effective protocols involve consuming **8-12 g CHO/kg/day** for 1-3 days alongside an exercise taper []. This can significantly delay fatigue.
3. **Pre-Event Meal:** Consume 1-4 g CHO/kg 1-4 hours before the event. Focus on familiar, easily digestible foods low in fat and fiber [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
4. **Intra-Event Fueling:** Essential for events >60-90 minutes.
    - Target **30-60 g CHO per hour** for events up to ~2.5 hours.
    - For longer ultra-endurance events, intake can increase up to **90 g CHO per hour**, utilizing multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., glucose/maltodextrin + fructose) for optimal absorption and oxidation []. Sources include sports drinks, gels, chews, bars, or suitable whole foods. Practice fueling strategy in training.
5. **Hydration & Electrolytes:** Critical for performance and health. Develop an individualized plan based on sweat rate, duration, and conditions to prevent >2% body weight loss [[C4. Hydration]]. Replace sodium and other key electrolytes [[C5. Electrolytes]] lost in sweat, especially during prolonged events (>2 hours) or in hot conditions.
6. **Adequate Protein Intake:** Supports muscle repair and adaptation. Typically **1.2-1.8 g/kg/day** recommended for endurance athletes [].
7. **Post-Exercise Recovery:** Timely intake of carbohydrates (1.0-1.2 g/kg/hour for first ~4h if rapid recovery needed) and protein (0.3-0.5 g/kg or 20-40g) is important, especially with frequent training sessions [[C3. Nutrient Timing]], [[C29. Nutrition for Recovery]].
8. **Micronutrient Considerations:** Monitor iron status (especially females), Vitamin D, and Calcium [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
