### **EXL-11: Barbell Incline Bench Press**

**ID:** EXL-11-BB-INCLINEBENCH **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An upper-body compound exercise performed lying on an incline bench (typically 15-45 degrees), involving lowering a barbell to the upper chest and pressing it back up. Emphasizes the clavicular (upper) head of the pectoralis major and anterior deltoids more than the flat bench press.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good shoulder stability and proper technique).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused reps, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Adjust Incline Angle (higher incline increases shoulder involvement).
- Dumbbell Incline Bench Press [[EXL-22 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Flat Barbell Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]].
- Machine Incline Chest Press [[B10. Machine Training]].
- Push-ups (potentially feet elevated) [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Improve shoulder mobility/stability [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]], [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major (clavicular head emphasized), Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Medial Deltoid, Serratus Anterior, Coracobrachialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Rotator Cuff muscles, Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]]. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set incline bench to desired angle (e.g., 30-45 degrees). Lie back on bench, feet flat on floor. Grip barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width. Maintain slight natural arch in lower back, retract and depress scapulae against bench. Unrack bar with straight arms over upper chest/shoulders.
- **Execution:** Inhale, lower bar under control towards the upper chest (clavicle area). Keep elbows tucked slightly (not flared). Touch chest lightly (or stop just above). Exhale and press bar back up following a path slightly back towards the starting position over the shoulders. Maintain contact points and stable shoulder position.
- **Breathing:** Inhale on descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Excessive arching of lower back (lifting glutes off bench), flaring elbows too wide, incorrect bar path (pressing too low or too far forward), bouncing bar off chest, shoulders rolling forward.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). Anterior shoulder instability. Ensure adequate shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]. May be more stressful on shoulders than flat press for some individuals [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Use a spotter for heavy sets. Use collars/clips. Control the weight, especially during the eccentric phase. Start with a moderate incline (e.g., 30 degrees).

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Reps performed at a specific load or RPE.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (bar path, elbow tuck, stability).
