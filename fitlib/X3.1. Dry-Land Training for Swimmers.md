### X3.1. Dry-Land Training for Swimmers
**ID:** X3.1-SWIMMING-DRYLAND
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Dry-land training enhances force production, core stability, shoulder health, and overall athleticism for swimmers.

**Benefits:** Increased propulsion, improved core stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]), shoulder injury prevention ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]), enhanced starts/turns, improved bone density.
**Key Areas:** Pulling strength (lats), Pressing strength (balance), Shoulder stability (rotator cuff), Core strength, Leg power, Mobility ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
**Programming:** 1-3x/week, complement swim schedule, periodized approach.
