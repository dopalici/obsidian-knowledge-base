### **EXL-51: Chest Press (Machine - Seated)**

**ID:** EXL-51-MEX-CHESTPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based exercise [[B10. Machine Training]] simulating a bench press, performed seated, involving pushing handles forward against resistance. Provides stability and isolates the chest, shoulders, and triceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Machine Press (increases core involvement).
- Progress to Dumbbell Bench Press [[EXL-21 Dumbbell Bench Press (Flat)]] or Barbell Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Push-ups (Incline or Knee versions) [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Resistance Band Chest Press [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoid, Triceps Brachii.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Coracobrachialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so handles are aligned with mid-chest when seated. Sit with back firmly against pad, feet flat on floor. Grip handles with desired grip (often neutral or pronated). Retract and depress scapulae (shoulders back and down).
- **Execution:** Exhale and press handles forward until arms are fully extended (avoid forceful lockout). Focus on contracting chest muscles. Keep shoulders down and back. Inhale and slowly return handles to starting position under control, feeling a stretch across chest.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during press (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Shoulders rolling forward/elevating, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled return phase, lifting back off pad.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or elbow injuries. Fixed path may cause discomfort for some individuals compared to free weights.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat adjustment. Control the weight throughout movement. Avoid slamming weight stack.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (shoulder position, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
