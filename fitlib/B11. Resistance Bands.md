### B11. Resistance Bands
**ID:** B11-RESISTANCE-BANDS
**Created:** 2025-04-23 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Resistance bands are versatile elastic tools providing accommodating resistance that increases as the band is stretched further. They are portable, inexpensive, and applicable across various training contexts from rehabilitation to performance enhancement.

**Benefits:**
- **Accommodating Resistance:** Resistance increases throughout the range of motion, often matching ascending strength curves where muscles can produce more force towards end ROM (e.g., squats, bench press). Provides unique stimulus compared to constant free weight resistance.
- **Portability & Cost-Effectiveness:** Lightweight, easy to store/transport, relatively inexpensive compared to weights/machines. Ideal for home gyms or travel.
- **Versatility:** Wide range of applications:
    - *Warm-up/Activation:* Low-resistance exercises to activate specific muscles (e.g., glutes, rotator cuff).
    - *Mobility/Stretching:* Assisted stretching, joint distractions/mobilizations.
    - *Assistance:* Reducing effective bodyweight for exercises like pull-ups, dips.
    - *Resistance:* Providing primary resistance for exercises (rows, presses, squats, hinges) or adding variable resistance to free weight exercises (e.g., banded squats/bench/deadlifts).
    - *Rehabilitation:* Low-impact resistance suitable for early-stage rehab.
- **Joint Friendly:** Can provide effective stimulus with potentially less joint stress at certain points in ROM compared to heavy free weights.
- **Multi-Planar Resistance:** Can provide resistance in vectors not possible with gravity alone (e.g., rotational, horizontal movements).

**Types:**
- **Therapy Bands/Sheets:** Flat, light resistance. Common in physical therapy.
- **Loop Bands (Power Bands):** Thick, continuous loops. Various resistance levels (color-coded). Widely used for assistance/resistance/mobility.
- **Tube Bands with Handles:** Often used for mimicking cable/dumbbell exercises.
- **Mini Bands (Hip Circles):** Small loops worn around knees/ankles. Primarily for hip/glute activation and strengthening.

**Limitations:**
- **Quantifying Resistance:** Difficult to precisely measure resistance level, varies with band thickness, stretch distance, degradation over time. Makes tracking progressive overload less precise than with weights.
- **Resistance Profile:** Ascending resistance may not be optimal for all exercises or goals (e.g., may underload initial ROM).
- **Maximum Resistance:** Limited potential for very heavy loading compared to barbells/machines.

**Programming:** Integrate based on specific goal: add accommodating resistance to main lifts, use for assistance/accessory work, warm-ups, mobility, or as primary resistance for home/travel workouts.
