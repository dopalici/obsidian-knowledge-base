### IX-1. Common Musculoskeletal Injuries
**ID:** IX-1-COMMON-MSK-INJURIES
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries involve damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, or joints, often resulting from acute trauma or chronic overuse related to physical activity. Understanding common types helps in prevention and appropriate management.

**Common Injury Types:**
1.  **Strains (Muscle/Tendon):** Tearing due to excessive tensile force. Graded I-III. Common: Hamstrings, quads, adductors, calf, rotator cuff.
2.  **Sprains (Ligament):** Stretching/tearing due to joint forced beyond normal ROM. Graded I-III. Common: Ankle (lateral), knee (ACL, MCL), wrist.
3.  **Tendinopathy:** Tendon pain/dysfunction, often involving degeneration (tendinosis) more than acute inflammation (tendinitis), especially chronic cases. Overuse/failed healing. Common: Achilles, patellar, rotator cuff, elbow epicondylitis.
4.  **Stress Fractures:** Microfractures from repetitive loading without adequate recovery/remodeling. Common: Tibia, metatarsals, navicular. Risk factors: load errors, low bone density, LEA ([[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]).
5.  **Lower Back Pain (LBP):** Multifactorial. Muscle/ligament strain, disc issues, facet joint problems. Often related to poor mechanics ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]), posture, core instability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]), overuse.
6.  **Shoulder Impingement Syndrome:** Compression of rotator cuff/bursa in subacromial space. Related to cuff weakness, scapular dyskinesis, poor posture.
7.  **Knee Pain (Anterior):** Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS - "runner's knee"), Patellar Tendinopathy ("jumper's knee"). Often related to tracking, muscle imbalances, overuse.
8.  **Shin Splints (Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome - MTSS):** Diffuse tibial pain. Overuse injury related to periosteal traction/bone stress.
9.  **Plantar Fasciitis:** Plantar fascia inflammation/degeneration causing heel pain. Overuse related to mechanics, tight calves, footwear.

**General Risk Factors:** Previous injury, training load errors, inadequate recovery, muscle imbalances, poor technique, anatomical factors, equipment, age, low energy availability.
