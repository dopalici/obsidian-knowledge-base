### **EXL-19: Zercher Squat**

**ID:** EXL-19-BB-ZERCHERSQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A squat variation where the barbell is held in the crook of the elbows, rather than on the back or front shoulders. This unique loading position places high demand on the upper back, core, and biceps, while allowing for a very upright torso.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires pain tolerance in elbows, strong core/upper back, and good squat mechanics).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused at bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Zercher Carries.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use empty bar.
- Goblet Squat [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]] (similar upright torso, easier hold).
- Front Squat [[EXL-08 Barbell Front Squat]] (different loading, still upright torso).
- Back Squat [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]].
- Improve core strength [[L4. Core Stability Training]] and upper back strength. Use padding in elbows if needed.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus, Hamstrings.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae (significant upper back demand), Core Musculature (very high demand), Biceps Brachii (isometric hold), Forearms, Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set barbell in a rack at roughly navel height. Position bar deep into the crook of elbows, clasp hands together tightly near chest. Lift bar out of rack. Stance typically shoulder-width or slightly wider, toes slightly out. Maintain very upright torso, brace core extremely hard.
- **Execution:** Inhale, brace. Descend by breaking at hips and knees simultaneously, keeping torso as vertical as possible. Keep elbows tight to body. Descend to full depth (often deeper than back squat due to upright posture). Drive up through mid-foot, leading with chest, extending hips and knees. Maintain core brace and upright posture throughout.
- **Breathing:** Deep inhale and brace before descent, hold or forcefully exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Losing upper back position (rounding forward), dropping elbows, insufficient core brace leading to forward lean, discomfort limiting depth/load.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Elbow pain/injury, biceps tendon issues. Significant discomfort in the elbow crease is common and may limit usability. Requires very strong core and upper back [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Can be uncomfortable/painful on elbow crease (use padding if necessary). Start very light to test tolerance and master technique. Requires immense core bracing. Be prepared to dump bar forward safely if needed.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of technique (torso angle, depth, core stability).
