### **EXL-04: Barbell Sumo Deadlift**

**ID:** EXL-04-BB-DEADLIFT-SUMO **Created:** 2025-04-28

**(Brief Description):** A deadlift variation characterized by a very wide stance and a grip inside the legs. It alters leverage and muscle emphasis compared to the conventional deadlift, often utilizing more hips/quads and requiring greater hip mobility.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Technically demanding, requires specific hip mobility).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Paused reps off floor, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Block Pulls (reduced ROM).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Conventional Deadlift [[EXL-03 Barbell Conventional Deadlift]].
- Kettlebell Sumo Deadlift [[B9. Kettlebell Training]].
- Wide Stance Goblet Squat [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]].
- Improve hip mobility (external rotation, abduction) [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Adductor Magnus. Hamstrings contribute but often less than conventional.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Erector Spinae (isometric), Trapezius, Rhomboids.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Forearm flexors (grip), Gluteus Medius/Minimus. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet very wide (shins near or outside rings), toes pointed significantly outwards (towards plates). Bar close to shins. Hinge at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] and bend knees, keeping torso relatively upright compared to conventional. Grip bar inside legs (double overhand or mixed grip). Shoulders typically directly over or slightly behind bar. Maintain neutral spine, chest up. Pull slack out, brace core (Valsalva).
- **Execution:** Initiate by driving through feet, spreading floor apart. Extend hips and knees. Keep torso upright, drive hips forward powerfully into the bar ("wedge"). Bar should travel straight up close to body. Finish standing tall with hips/knees locked, shoulders back. Lower under control by reversing motion (hinge hips, then bend knees).
- **Breathing:** Deep inhale and brace before pull, hold during lift, exhale at top or during controlled descent.
- **Common Faults:** Hips rising too early, rounding back (less common than conventional but possible), knees caving inward, failing to lock out hips, bar drifting forward.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or hip injuries (requires significant hip mobility). May aggravate hip impingement or adductor strains in some individuals [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Master technique. Requires good hip external rotation and adductor flexibility. Maintain neutral spine. Control weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) or specific multi-rep max [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load lifted for specified reps/sets.
- Qualitative assessment of technique (upright torso, hip drive, knee tracking).
