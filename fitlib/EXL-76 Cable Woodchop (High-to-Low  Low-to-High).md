### **EXL-76: Cable Woodchop (High-to-Low / Low-to-High)**

**ID:** EXL-76-CEX-WOODCHOP **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A rotational core exercise using a cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]], involving pulling a handle diagonally across the body, either from a high anchor point downwards (high-to-low) or a low anchor point upwards (low-to-high). Targets the obliques and other core muscles involved in rotation and anti-rotation [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good core control and coordination).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Controlled rotation, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Perform in half-kneeling or tall-kneeling stance (increases stability challenge).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Reduce Range of Motion (less rotation).
- Pallof Press [[EXL-77 Cable Pallof Press (Anti-Rotation)]] (focuses on anti-rotation, less dynamic).
- Resistance Band Woodchops [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Bodyweight Russian Twists [[EXL-90 Russian Twist (Bodyweight or Weighted)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Obliques (Internal and External), Rectus Abdominis. (Emphasis differs slightly between high-low and low-high).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Hip Rotators, Shoulders (Deltoids), Arms (assist in controlling handle).
- **Stabilizers:** Transverse Abdominis, Glutes, Erector Spinae, Muscles of the legs/feet providing base of support [[L4. Core Stability Training]]..

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (High-to-Low):** Set pulley to high position. Stand sideways to machine, feet shoulder-width apart, stable stance. Grasp handle (rope or D-handle) with both hands, arms mostly straight.
- **Setup (Low-to-High):** Set pulley to low position. Stand sideways, grasp handle.
- **Execution (High-to-Low):** Keeping arms relatively straight, rotate torso diagonally downwards across body, pulling handle towards opposite knee/hip. Pivot on back foot as needed. Movement driven by core rotation, not just arms. Control the return path slowly.
- **Execution (Low-to-High):** Keeping arms relatively straight, rotate torso diagonally upwards across body, pulling handle towards opposite shoulder. Pivot on back foot. Control the return path.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during chopping motion (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pulling primarily with arms, excessive bending of elbows, insufficient core rotation/engagement, losing posture, using momentum, pivoting improperly.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back pain (especially rotation-sensitive conditions like disc issues), shoulder injuries. Requires careful control to avoid straining back or shoulders.
- **Safety:** Start with light weight to master rotational control. Maintain neutral spine. Focus on controlled rotation initiated from core. Ensure stable footing.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (controlled rotation, core engagement, stable posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
