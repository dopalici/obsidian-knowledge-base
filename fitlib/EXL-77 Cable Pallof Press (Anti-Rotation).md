### **EXL-77: Cable Pallof Press (Anti-Rotation)**

**ID:** EXL-77-CEX-PALLOFPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An anti-rotation core stability exercise [[L4. Core Stability Training]] using a cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]]. Involves holding a handle at chest height with arms extended and resisting the cable's rotational pull on the torso.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Lever Arm (press handle further away from body, potentially overhead).
- Increase Hold Time / Perform Slow Reps [[B19. Isometrics]], [[B20. Eccentric Training]].
- Decrease Base of Support (Narrow stance, split stance, half-kneeling, tall-kneeling).
- Add perturbations (e.g., partner lightly taps hands/handle).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Move closer to cable stack (reduces lever arm of resistance).
- Widen base of support.
- Shorter hold times or perform reps with shorter extension.
- Resistance Band Pallof Press [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Plank variations [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]]
**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Stabilizers (Anti-Rotation):** Obliques (Internal and External - especially side further from stack), Transverse Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis, Erector Spinae, Quadratus Lumborum.
- **Secondary Stabilizers:** Glutes, Hip Rotators, Shoulders (Deltoids, Rotator Cuff - holding handle position), Pectorals.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Set pulley to chest height. Stand sideways to machine, feet shoulder-width apart, stable athletic stance, knees slightly bent. Grasp D-handle with both hands, interlocking fingers or one hand over other. Step away from stack until there is tension on cable. Hold handle centered at chest/sternum level.
- **Execution:** Brace core tightly. Press handle straight out directly in front of chest until arms are fully extended. Resist the rotational pull from the cable – **do not let torso rotate towards the machine**. Hold the extended position briefly (or for prescribed time), maintaining square hips and shoulders. Slowly return handle back to chest under control. Complete reps for one side before switching sides.
- **Breathing:** Breathe steadily throughout, maintaining core brace. Often exhale on press out, inhale on return, or breathe shallowly during holds.
- **Common Faults:** Allowing torso/hips to rotate towards machine, insufficient core brace, shrugging shoulders, bending arms during hold/press.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or shoulder injuries.
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form, focus on resisting rotation. Control the movement. Use appropriate weight – goal is stability, not moving heavy loads dynamically.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load held/pressed for specific reps/sets/hold times [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal rotation, core stability, posture) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Ability to maintain stability with progressions (e.g., narrower stance).
