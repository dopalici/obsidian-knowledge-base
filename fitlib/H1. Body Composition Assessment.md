### H1. Body Composition Assessment

**ID:** H1-BODY-COMPOSITION

**Created:** 2025-04-24

  

Body composition refers to the relative proportions of different tissues that make up total body mass, typically divided into fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM - includes muscle, bone, water, organs). Assessing body composition provides more meaningful information about health status and fitness progress than body weight or BMI alone.

  

**Models:**

- **2-Component (2C):** Divides body into FM and FFM. Most common model, used by methods like hydrostatic weighing, air displacement, BIA, skinfolds. Assumes constant densities/hydration of FFM, which can introduce error.

- **Multi-Component (3C, 4C, 5C):** Divide body into more compartments (e.g., adding total body water, bone mineral content). More accurate as they account for variability in FFM components. DEXA is effectively a 3C model (FM, bone mineral, lean soft tissue). 4C (adding water measurement) often considered gold standard research method.

  

**Common Assessment Methods (Varying Accuracy/Accessibility):**

1. **Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA):** Uses low-dose X-rays to differentiate bone mineral, fat mass, and lean soft tissue. Provides regional data (arms, legs, trunk). Often considered practical reference standard. SEE (Standard Error of Estimate) ~1-3%. Requires specialized equipment/technician.

2. **Hydrostatic Weighing (Underwater Weighing):** Determines body density based on Archimedes' principle (body volume measured by water displacement). Uses 2C model equations (e.g., Siri, Brozek) to estimate %Fat. SEE ~2-3%. Requires submersion, specialized tank.

3. **Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP - e.g., Bod Pod):** Determines body volume by measuring air displacement in sealed chamber. Uses 2C model equations. SEE ~2-4%. Less invasive than underwater weighing. Requires specialized equipment.

4. **Skinfold Calipers:** Measures thickness of subcutaneous fat at specific body sites. Uses equations (e.g., Jackson-Pollock) to predict body density and %Fat (2C model). Accuracy highly dependent on technician skill, caliper quality, equation used. SEE ~3-5%+. Inexpensive, portable.

5. **Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA):** Sends low-level electrical current through body, measures impedance (resistance/reactance). Estimates total body water, then FFM/FM (2C model). Accuracy highly variable depending on device type (handheld, scale, segmental, multi-frequency), hydration status, food intake, recent exercise. SEE ~3-8%+. Convenient, widely available (consumer scales).

6. **Anthropometric Measurements (Circumferences):** Using tape measure for waist, hip, limbs. Waist circumference strongly linked to visceral fat and health risk. Circumference ratios (e.g., Waist-to-Hip Ratio - WHR) also used. Don't directly measure %Fat but track changes and health risk. BMI (Body Mass Index = kg/mÂ²) is a screening tool for populations, poor indicator of individual body composition.

  

**Best Practices for Tracking Changes:**

- Use the same method consistently under standardized conditions (e.g., same time of day, fasted, hydrated, same device/technician).

- Focus on trends over time rather than absolute %Fat values, as all methods have error.

- Combine with other measures (photos, performance, clothing fit) for a holistic view.
