**Created:** 2025-04-26

Analyzing the biomechanics of sprinting involves understanding the forces produced and movements executed during ground contact across different phases (acceleration, max velocity). This provides insight into performance determinants and technical optimization.

**Key Biomechanical Variables:**
- **Ground Reaction Forces (GRF):** Forces exerted by the ground on the foot during contact. Measured with force plates. Crucial components:
    - *Vertical GRF:* Supports body weight, contributes to flight time. Peak forces can exceed 2-3x body weight at max velocity.
    - *Anterior-Posterior (Horizontal) GRF:* Braking forces (negative) occur upon landing, Propulsive forces (positive) occur during push-off. Net horizontal impulse (propulsive - braking) determines acceleration. Maximizing propulsion and minimizing braking is key.
    - *Medio-Lateral GRF:* Side-to-side forces, generally minimized for efficiency.
- **Ground Contact Time (GCT):** Duration foot is in contact with ground. Decreases significantly from acceleration (~0.2s) to max velocity (<0.1s). Minimizing GCT at max velocity is critical.
- **Flight Time (FT):** Duration both feet are off the ground. Increases with speed.
- **Stride Length (SL):** Distance covered between successive foot strikes of the same foot. Increases during acceleration, optimizes at max velocity.
- **Stride Frequency (SF) / Cadence:** Number of strides per unit time (steps/sec or steps/min). Increases significantly during acceleration, peaks at max velocity (~4.5-5+ steps/sec elite). Sprint Velocity â‰ˆ SL x SF.
- **Joint Kinematics:** Angles, velocities, accelerations of hip, knee, ankle joints throughout stride cycle. Indicate movement patterns, ROM utilized, coordination.
- **Center of Mass (COG) Kinematics:** Vertical displacement, horizontal velocity fluctuations. Minimizing vertical oscillation and maintaining forward velocity is efficient.
- **Power Output:** Mechanical power generated, particularly horizontal power during acceleration and vertical power during max velocity (Power = Force x Velocity).
- **Force-Velocity (F-V) Profile:** Individual relationship between ability to produce force and velocity. Some athletes are more force-deficient, others more velocity-deficient. Profiling can guide individualized training emphasis ([Morin & Samozino, 2016]).

**Phase-Specific Biomechanics:**
- **Acceleration:** Maximize net horizontal GRF. Requires large propulsive impulse, achieved via powerful triple extension and backward push-off with foot landing behind COG. Forward lean essential.
- **Max Velocity:** Maximize vertical GRF applied rapidly during very short GCT to counteract gravity and propel body forward. Requires high reactive strength, stiff leg spring mechanics, efficient SSC utilization. Minimize braking forces by landing foot close to under COG.

**Analysis Tools:** High-speed video analysis, force plates, motion capture systems, GPS/accelerometer devices (provide estimates).
