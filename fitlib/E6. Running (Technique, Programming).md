### E6. Running (Technique, Programming)
**ID:** E6-RUNNING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Running is a popular form of cardiovascular exercise and competitive sport. Technique and structured programming are key for performance and injury prevention.

**Technique Fundamentals (Ongoing Debate, General Principles):**
- **Posture:** Upright torso, slight forward lean from ankles. Relaxed shoulders.
- **Arm Swing:** Forward/backward motion from shoulder, elbows bent ~90 degrees, coordinated with legs.
- **Foot Strike:** Varies (heel, midfoot, forefoot). Aim for landing close to under center of mass, avoiding excessive overstriding.
- **Cadence (Stride Rate):** Higher cadence (~170-185+ steps/min) often associated with lower impact forces and improved efficiency.
- **Breathing:** Rhythmic, deep diaphragmatic breathing.

**Programming Components:**
- **Base Building:** Increase weekly mileage gradually with mostly [[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]].
- **Intensity:** Incorporate Easy Runs, Tempo/Threshold Runs ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]), Interval Training ([[E4. Interval Training (General)]], [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]]), Long Runs.
- **Periodization ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]):** Structure training into phases (base, build, peak, taper) for goal races.
- **Cross-Training ([[E10. Cross-Training for Endurance Athletes]]):** Reduce impact, address imbalances.
- **Strength Training:** Essential for injury prevention/performance ([[X1.1. Strength Training for Runners]]).

**Injury Prevention ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]):** Gradual progression, proper footwear, technique awareness, strength training, adequate recovery.
