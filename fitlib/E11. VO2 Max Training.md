### E11. VO2 Max Training
**ID:** E11-VO2MAX-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

VO2 max represents the maximum rate at which an individual can take in, transport, and utilize oxygen during intense exercise. Training specifically aims to increase this ceiling of aerobic capacity.

**Physiological Determinants:** Central factors (Max Cardiac Output, O2 carrying capacity) and Peripheral factors (muscle blood flow, capillary/mitochondrial density, O2 extraction) ([[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]]).

**Training Stimulus:** Requires exercising at intensities near VO2 max (>90% HRmax or vVO2max) to maximally stress oxygen transport/utilization.

**Effective Training Methods:**
- **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT - [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]]):** Most potent stimulus. Intervals typically 2-5 min at ~90-100% VO2max intensity, work:rest often ~1:1.
- **Supramaximal Interval Training (SIT):** May also improve VO2max.
- **Tempo/Threshold Training ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]):** Contributes indirectly by improving sustainable %VO2max.

**Programming:** Highly demanding, typically 1-2 sessions/week during specific phases, balanced with sufficient low-intensity volume ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]). Requires adequate base fitness.

**Limitations:** Significant genetic component to VO2max and trainability. Not sole determinant of endurance performance (threshold, economy also crucial).
