### **EXL-99: Ski Ergometer**

**ID:** EXL-99-CARDIO-SKIERG **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An exercise machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] simulating the poling motion of Nordic (cross-country) skiing. Provides a challenging full-body cardiovascular workout with significant emphasis on the upper body and core. Uses air resistance via a flywheel, similar to a rowing ergometer [[EXL-96 Rowing Ergometer (Rower)]].

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (intensity controlled by effort/pace). Technique influences efficiency.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Pace (Decrease time/distance or Increase Watts/Calories per hour) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration or Distance [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Stroke Rate (pulls per minute) - combine with powerful pulls.
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]] / [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].
- Perform alternating arm pulls (single-arm skiing).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Pace / Exertion Level.
- Decrease Duration or Distance.
- Focus on technique drills at low intensity.
- Perform seated if necessary (reduces lower body/core involvement).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Latissimus Dorsi, Triceps, Core (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Erector Spinae), Shoulders (Deltoids), Pectorals, Hip Flexors, Glutes, Hamstrings (less than rowing, but involved in hip hinge/power transfer). Engages a large amount of muscle mass.
- **Stabilizers:** Scapular stabilizers, Rotator Cuff [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]] (Core/Spine Principles)

- **Setup:** Stand facing machine, feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent. Grasp handles with overhand grip.
- **Execution:** Initiate pull by engaging core and hinging slightly at hips while raising arms overhead (or near overhead). Drive handles downward forcefully using lats, core, and triceps, extending hips and slightly bending knees simultaneously in a "crunching" motion. Finish with arms extended down past thighs. Control the return phase, extending arms back up while straightening torso/legs. Maintain fluid, powerful rhythm.
- **Breathing:** Typically exhale during downward pull (concentric), inhale during upward return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pulling only with arms (insufficient core/hip involvement), excessive back rounding or arching, incomplete range of motion (not reaching up or pulling through fully), poor rhythm.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or low back injuries. Requires good core control and shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- **Safety:** Learn proper technique focusing on core engagement and hip hinge. Start with lower intensity (damper setting and pace). Maintain neutral spine.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Time for specific distances (e.g., 500m, 1000m, 2k) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Average Pace (time/500m), Power (Watts), Stroke Rate (SPM).
- Duration or Distance skied.
- Calories per hour (monitor display).
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
