### A24. Principle of Diminishing Returns

*(Content based on FZC-1.6)*
The Principle of Diminishing Returns states that as fitness level increases towards genetic potential, the rate of adaptation slows, and larger training stimuli are needed for smaller improvements. Beginners improve rapidly; advanced athletes require optimized training/recovery for marginal gains.

**Implications:** Manage expectations for long-term progress ([[H2. Realistic Muscle Gain Rates]]). Training must become more precise and optimized at higher levels. Risk/reward of pushing for small gains increases.
