### **EXL-30: Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)**

**ID:** EXL-30-DB-BICEPCURL-ALT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the elbow flexors, performed standing while alternating curls between the left and right arms using dumbbells. Allows focus on each arm individually.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Simultaneous Standing Dumbbell Curl.
- Seated Alternating Dumbbell Curl (stricter).
- Incline Dumbbell Curl (alternating or simultaneous) [[EXL-33 Dumbbell Incline Curl]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Bicep Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Cable Curls [[EXL-69 Cable Bicep Curl (BarHandles)]].
- Focus on compound pulling exercises first (Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]], Pulldowns [[EXL-56 Lat Pulldown (Machine - Wide Grip)]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Anterior Deltoid, Wrist Flexors/Extensors, Scapular stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand upright, feet shoulder-width, core engaged, slight knee bend. Hold dumbbells at sides, palms facing forward (supinated grip). Elbows tucked close to torso. Good posture.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arm stationary, exhale and curl one dumbbell towards shoulder, focusing on biceps contraction. Squeeze at top. Inhale and lower dumbbell under control back to starting position (full elbow extension). Repeat with the other arm. Alternate arms for desired reps. Avoid using momentum or torso swing.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl, inhale during lowering.
- **Common Faults:** Swinging torso/using momentum, elbows moving forward, incomplete range of motion, using shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries. Use caution with shoulder pain.
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form. Keep upper arms stable. Control eccentric. Use appropriate weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load with strict form.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, stable upper arms) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
