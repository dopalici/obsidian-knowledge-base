### B20. Eccentric Training
**ID:** B20-ECCENTRIC-TRAINING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Eccentric training emphasizes the lengthening phase of muscle contraction, where the muscle produces force while increasing in length (e.g., lowering a weight). Muscles can produce significantly more force eccentrically (~20-50%) than concentrically.

**Methods:**
- **Slow Eccentrics:** Intentionally slowing lowering phase (e.g., 3-6 second negative).
- **Supramaximal Eccentrics:** Using load > concentric 1RM for eccentric phase only (requires assistance/special equipment).
- **Eccentric Overload Devices:** Machines providing greater eccentric resistance.
- **Plyometrics:** Utilize stretch-shortening cycle (rapid eccentric loading).

**Benefits:**
- **Greater Strength Gains:** Supramaximal eccentrics enhance both eccentric/concentric strength.
- **Enhanced Hypertrophy:** Eccentric phase important stimulus for muscle damage/hypertrophy signaling (related to [[B3. Hypertrophy Training Principles]]).
- **Improved Tendon Health/Stiffness:** Effective stimulus for tendon adaptation/rehab (e.g., Alfredson protocol).
- **Injury Prevention:** May reduce muscle strain risk by improving eccentric strength/architecture.
- **Improved Deceleration Ability.**

**Considerations:** Causes significantly more muscle damage (EIMD) and DOMS (related to [[M1. Recovery Modalities Evidence and Application]]), requires careful progression/recovery. Supramaximal methods carry higher risk if implemented incorrectly.
