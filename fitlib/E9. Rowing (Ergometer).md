### E9. Rowing (Ergometer)
**ID:** E9-ROWING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Indoor rowing (using an ergometer, "erg") is a full-body, low-impact exercise simulating on-water rowing, providing excellent cardiovascular and muscular endurance stimulus.

**Technique Fundamentals (Stroke Cycle):** Catch -> Drive (Legs -> Core -> Arms) -> Finish -> Recovery (Arms -> Core -> Legs). Proper sequencing crucial.

**Programming Components:**
- **Technique Focus:** Essential for efficiency/injury prevention.
- **Volume:** Measured by distance or time.
- **Intensity:** Prescribed via pace (time/500m), power (watts), stroke rate (SPM), RPE, or HR zones.
- **Workout Types:** Steady State ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]), Interval Training ([[E4. Interval Training (General)]]) targeting threshold ([[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]), VO2max ([[E11. VO2 Max Training]]), or anaerobic capacity. Time trials (e.g., 2000m).

**Benefits:** Full body, low impact, high caloric expenditure, measurable feedback.

**Considerations:** Requires ergometer access. Proper technique needed to avoid lower back strain.
