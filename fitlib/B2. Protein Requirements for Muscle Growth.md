### B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth
**ID:** B2-PROTEIN-REQUIREMENTS
**Created:** 2025-04-23 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Consuming sufficient dietary protein is essential for maximizing the adaptive response to resistance training, specifically muscle protein synthesis (MPS), which drives muscle repair and hypertrophy ([[B3. Hypertrophy Training Principles]]). Protein provides the necessary amino acid building blocks.

**Recommended Intakes (g/kg bodyweight/day):**
- **Sedentary Adults (RDA):** ~0.8 g/kg (minimum to prevent deficiency, insufficient for optimizing RT adaptations).
- **Optimizing Muscle Growth (Resistance Training):** Strong consensus suggests **1.6-2.2 g/kg/day** is optimal for most individuals engaging in resistance training aiming to maximize muscle mass ([ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise, 2017]; Morton et al., 2018).
- **Upper Range Considerations:** While benefits beyond 2.2 g/kg are less clear and likely minimal for most, intakes up to ~2.5-3.0 g/kg may offer slight advantages in specific contexts like experienced lifters aiming for maximal gains or during significant caloric restriction.
- **During Caloric Restriction (Fat Loss):** Higher intakes within the 1.8-2.7 g/kg range (or even slightly higher based on lean mass) are recommended to preserve LBM ([Helms ER, et al., 2014]). Leaner individuals or those in larger deficits should aim for the higher end.

**Optimal Distribution & Timing:**
- **Per Meal Dose:** Consuming **0.3-0.5 g/kg** of high-quality protein per meal (typically equates to 20-40g) appears sufficient to maximally stimulate MPS acutely ([Moore DR, et al., 2015]). Consuming more in a single sitting doesn't seem to further boost MPS acutely but contributes to total daily intake.
- **Daily Distribution:** Spreading protein intake relatively evenly across **4-5 meals/snacks** throughout the day is likely optimal for maximizing the cumulative MPS response over 24 hours ([Areta et al., 2013]).
- **Peri-Workout Timing ([[C3. Nutrient Timing]]):** Consuming protein (~20-40g) within a couple of hours before and/or after training can support recovery and adaptation, though total daily intake and distribution are primary factors.
- **Pre-Sleep Protein:** Consuming slow-digesting protein like casein (~30-40g) before sleep can increase overnight MPS and improve recovery ([Trommelen & van Loon, 2016]).

**Protein Quality:** Focus on high-quality sources rich in essential amino acids (EAAs), particularly leucine (a key trigger for MPS). Animal sources (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy) and soy are complete proteins. Plant-based eaters should combine sources or consume slightly higher total protein to ensure adequate EAA profile ([[C11. Vegetarian & Vegan Diets]]).
