### **EXL-34: Dumbbell Triceps Kickback**

**ID:** EXL-34-DB-TRICKICKBACK **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the triceps brachii, performed typically in a bent-over position (often supported), involving extending the elbow against gravity with a dumbbell.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Often performed incorrectly with excessive momentum).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]] (Challenging to progress load significantly with strict form).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Strong peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Cable Triceps Kickbacks (provides constant tension).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Triceps Extensions (e.g., on bench edge).
- Triceps Pushdowns [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]].
- Overhead Triceps Extensions [[EXL-35 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)]] (often allows more load).
- Resistance Band Triceps Kickbacks [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (all heads, potentially greater emphasis on lateral/medial heads due to shoulder position).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Hamstrings, Glutes (if unsupported bent-over), Rotator Cuff, Posterior Deltoid (maintaining upper arm position).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Can be done unsupported (hinged at hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]], neutral spine, torso near parallel to floor) or supported (one hand/knee on bench similar to [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]]). Hold dumbbell with neutral grip. Bring upper arm parallel to torso and lock it in place; elbow bent at 90 degrees.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arm completely stationary, exhale and extend elbow fully by contracting triceps, pushing dumbbell straight back. Focus on achieving peak contraction at full extension. Pause briefly. Inhale and slowly lower dumbbell back to the 90-degree starting position under control. Movement should only occur at the elbow joint.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during extension (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Moving upper arm (using shoulder/lat), using momentum/swinging weight, incomplete range of motion (not fully extending elbow), dropping weight uncontrolled.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow injuries. Requires stable shoulder to keep upper arm fixed. Unsupported version requires good hip hinge and back stability.
- **Safety:** Prioritize keeping upper arm stationary. Use strict form; momentum defeats the purpose of the isolation. Use lighter weights focused on contraction quality.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets with strict form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arm, peak contraction, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
