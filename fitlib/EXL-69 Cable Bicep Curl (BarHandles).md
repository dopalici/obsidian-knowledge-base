### **EXL-69: Cable Bicep Curl (Bar/Handles)**

**ID:** EXL-69-CEX-BICEPCURL **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the elbow flexors (biceps, brachialis). Cables provide constant tension throughout the range of motion, differing from the varying resistance curve of free weights.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Peak contraction squeeze, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Attachment Variations (Straight bar, EZ-bar, Single handles - allows more wrist rotation/supination).
- Cable Preacher Curl.
- Progress to free weight curls [[EXL-30 Dumbbell Bicep Curl (Standing, Alternating)]], [[EXL-14 Barbell Bicep Curl]], [[EXL-31 Dumbbell Hammer Curl]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Bicep Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Machine Bicep Curl [[EXL-60 Bicep Curl (Machine - Preacher or Seated)]].
- Focus on compound pulling movements (Rows, Pulldowns).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Biceps Brachii, Brachialis.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Brachioradialis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Anterior Deltoid, Wrist Flexors.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach desired handle (e.g., straight bar, EZ-bar, D-handle) to low pulley cable. Stand or sit facing machine, grasp handle(s) with underhand (supinated) grip. Keep feet stable, core engaged, elbows tucked close to torso. Start with arms fully extended.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arms stationary, exhale and curl handle(s) upwards towards shoulders by flexing elbows. Focus on contracting biceps. Avoid leaning back or using momentum. Pause briefly at top. Inhale and slowly lower handle(s) back to starting position under control, achieving full elbow extension against the cable tension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during curl (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using body swing/momentum, elbows moving forward, incomplete range of motion (especially extension), shrugging shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or wrist injuries. Straight bar attachment may cause wrist discomfort for some.
- **Safety:** Maintain strict form. Keep upper arms stable. Control the weight, particularly the eccentric phase against constant tension.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, control, full ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
