### **EXL-78: Cable Glute Kickback**

**ID:** EXL-78-CEX-GLUTEKICKBACK **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] and an ankle strap attachment to target the gluteus maximus through hip extension.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Perform standing without support (increases stability demand).
- Progress to compound hip extension exercises like Hip Thrusts [[EXL-07 Barbell Hip Thrust]] or RDLs [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Glute Kickbacks [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Quadruped Hip Extensions (Bird Dog) [[L4. Core Stability Training]].
- Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Resistance Band Glute Kickbacks [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Gluteus Medius/Minimus (of stance leg), Quadriceps (of stance leg).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach an ankle strap cuff to a low pulley cable. Secure cuff around one ankle. Stand facing the machine, holding onto it lightly for balance. Step back slightly to create tension. Maintain slight bend in support knee, core engaged, neutral spine.
- **Execution:** Exhale and extend the cuffed leg straight back (hip extension), focusing on squeezing the glute of the working leg. Keep knee relatively straight (or slightly bent). Avoid excessive arching of the lower back; movement should primarily come from the hip. Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly return leg to starting position under control against cable tension. Complete reps for one side before switching.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during kickback (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Arching lower back excessively, using momentum/swinging leg, insufficient glute contraction, bending knee too much (turning into hamstring curl).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back or hip injuries. Requires good core control to prevent lumbar hyperextension.
- **Safety:** Maintain neutral spine. Control the movement, focus on glute contraction. Use appropriate weight.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip extension focus, minimal back arch, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
