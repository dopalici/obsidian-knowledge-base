### C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition
**ID:** C5-PRE-DURING-POST-EXERCISE
**Created:** 2025-04-24

*(Content based on Nutrient Timing principles - [[C3. Nutrient Timing]], but provides a specific focus)*
Strategic nutrient intake immediately before, during, and after exercise sessions can influence fuel availability, performance during the session, and the rate/effectiveness of recovery afterwards.

**Pre-Exercise Nutrition (1-4 hours before):**
- **Goal:** Maximize glycogen, ensure hydration, prevent hunger, provide amino acids.
- **Focus:** Carbs (1-4 g/kg), moderate protein (0.3-0.5 g/kg), low fat/fiber.

**Intra-Workout Nutrition (During):**
- **Goal:** Maintain blood glucose, spare glycogen, fuel prolonged/intense activity, maintain hydration/electrolytes.
- **Focus:** Needed for sessions >60-90 min. Carbs: 30-90 g/hour. Electrolytes (esp. sodium).

**Post-Exercise Nutrition (0-2+ hours after):**
- **Goal:** Replenish glycogen, stimulate MPS, rehydrate.
- **Focus:** Combine carbs (0.8-1.2 g/kg) and protein (0.3-0.5 g/kg or 20-40g). Timing more critical if recovery time short.
