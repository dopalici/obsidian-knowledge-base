### **EXL-46: Leg Press (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-46-MEX-LEGPRESS **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A machine-based compound exercise [[B10. Machine Training]] involving pushing a weighted sled or platform away from the body using the legs while seated or supine. Primarily targets quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Machine provides stability, making it generally easier to learn and load than free weight squats).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], pauses).
- Foot Position Variations (higher = more glute/hamstring emphasis; lower = more quad emphasis; wider = more adductor/glute; narrower = more outer quad - slight variations).
- Single-Leg Leg Press (increases stability demand, addresses imbalances).
- Progress to Hack Squat [[EXL-50 Hack Squat (Machine)]] or Free Weight Squats [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Bodyweight Squats [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] or Goblet Squats [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]].
- Machine Leg Extension [[EXL-47 Leg Extension (Machine)]].
- Machine Hamstring Curl [[EXL-48 Seated Leg Curl (Machine)]] / [[EXL-49 Lying Leg Curl (Machine)]].
- Wall Sit [[B19. Isometrics]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius), Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus), Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature (bracing against back pad) [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Calves (minor role).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Sit securely in machine, place feet flat on platform approximately shoulder-width apart (adjust based on comfort/goal). Ensure entire back, especially lower back and hips, remains firmly pressed against the back pad throughout the movement. Grip handles for stability. Release safety catches (if applicable).
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower the weight under control by bending hips and knees. Depth depends on machine type and individual mobility – lower until thighs are near torso _without_ allowing lower back/hips to lift off the pad (avoiding "butt wink" or lumbar flexion). Exhale and press the weight back to the starting position by extending hips and knees, driving through the heels and mid-foot. Avoid locking out knees completely at the top (maintain slight bend) to keep tension on muscles.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent (eccentric), exhale during pressing phase (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Lower back lifting off pad ("butt wink"), insufficient range of motion, locking out knees forcefully, feet placed too high/low causing unwanted stress, allowing knees to cave inwards (valgus).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries, severe low back pain/conditions (especially disc issues, as lumbar flexion under load is a risk if form breaks down). Requires careful attention to maintaining lumbar/hip contact with pad.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper setup and that safety catches are functioning and used correctly. Control the weight – do not let it crash down. Never allow lower back/hips to round off the pad. Avoid excessive loading beyond what allows good form through full ROM.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Time under tension.
- Qualitative assessment of form (lumbar stability, depth, knee tracking) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
