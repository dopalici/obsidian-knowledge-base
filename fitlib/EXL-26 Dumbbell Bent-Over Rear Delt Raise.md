### **EXL-26: Dumbbell Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise**

**ID:** EXL-26-DB-REARDELTRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the posterior (rear) deltoids and upper back muscles. It involves hinging at the hips and raising dumbbells out to the sides with arms nearly straight while maintaining a stable torso position.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good control and ability to maintain a hip hinge).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]] (progress cautiously, as smaller muscles are targeted).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Seated Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise (provides more stability).
- Cable Rear Delt Fly / Reverse Fly [[B10. Machine Training]].
- Machine Rear Delt Fly / Reverse Pec Deck [[EXL-55 Rear Delt Fly  Reverse Pec Deck (Machine)]].
- Face Pulls [[EXL-73 Cable Face Pull]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Perform with chest support on an incline bench (reduces stability requirement).
- Resistance Band Pull-Aparts [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound rowing movements [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], [[EXL-27 Dumbbell Row (Single Arm)]] which also work the rear deltoids.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Posterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Rhomboids, Trapezius (Middle), Infraspinatus, Teres Minor.
- **Stabilizers:** Erector Spinae, Hamstrings, Glutes (isometric hold), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Hinge at the hips [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]] until torso is near-parallel to the floor, maintaining a neutral spine (flat back). Knees slightly bent. Let dumbbells hang straight down towards floor, arms nearly straight with a slight bend in elbows.
- **Execution:** Keeping torso stationary and maintaining slight elbow bend, exhale and raise dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc, focusing on squeezing shoulder blades together and using rear deltoids. Arms should reach approximately parallel to floor (or slightly higher). Avoid using momentum or lifting the torso. Inhale and slowly lower dumbbells back to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Lifting torso up during the raise, using excessive momentum/swinging, bending elbows too much (turning it into a row), rounding the back, shrugging shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder or low back injuries. Requires good hip hinge mechanics and spinal stability. Seated or chest-supported variations may be better if back stability is an issue.
- **Safety:** Use relatively light weight, focusing on strict form and muscle contraction. Maintain neutral spine throughout. Control the movement.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets with strict form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, stable torso, controlled arc) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
