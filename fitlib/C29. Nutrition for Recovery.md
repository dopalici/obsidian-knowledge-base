Post-exercise nutrition is critical for optimizing recovery by replenishing fuel stores, promoting muscle repair and adaptation, reducing exercise-induced stress, and rehydrating the body. Effective recovery nutrition enhances readiness for subsequent training sessions and maximizes long-term adaptation [[A26. Principle of Recovery]].

**Key Recovery Nutrition Goals & Strategies ("The 4 R's"):**

1. **Refuel (Carbohydrates):**
    - **Goal:** Replenish muscle and liver glycogen stores depleted during exercise. Crucial for subsequent performance, especially if training again within <8-12 hours.
    - **Strategy:** Consume **1.0-1.2 g CHO/kg/hour** for the first ~4 hours post-exercise if rapid replenishment is the priority [[C3. Nutrient Timing]]. Total daily carbohydrate intake remains the primary determinant of full glycogen restoration [[C2. Macronutrient Distribution]]. Combining carbs with protein may slightly enhance glycogen synthesis [].
2. **Repair (Protein):**
    - **Goal:** Provide essential amino acids (EAAs) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS), counter muscle protein breakdown, and repair exercise-induced muscle damage.
    - **Strategy:** Consume **0.3-0.5 g/kg or 20-40g** of high-quality protein (rich in leucine) within ~0-2 hours post-exercise [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]]. Continue regular protein intake (evenly distributed across 4-5 meals) throughout the day to sustain MPS [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].
3. **Rehydrate (Fluids & Electrolytes):**
    - **Goal:** Replace fluid and electrolytes lost through sweat to restore euhydration and plasma volume.
    - **Strategy:** Consume **~125-150%** of the fluid deficit (estimated from body weight change) within 2-6 hours post-exercise. Include sodium (~0.5-0.7 g/L) in recovery fluids to aid fluid retention and stimulate thirst [[C4. Hydration]], [[C5. Electrolytes]].
4. **Reduce (Inflammation/Oxidative Stress - with nuance):**
    - **Goal:** Manage excessive inflammation and oxidative stress while allowing necessary adaptive signaling.
    - **Strategy:** Emphasize whole foods rich in **phytonutrients and natural antioxidants** (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds) [[C33. Anti-Inflammatory FoodsDiets]], [[C34. Antioxidants]]. Omega-3 fatty acids may help resolve inflammation [[C22. Supplements with LimitedMixed Evidence (Group B)]]. **Caution:** High-dose antioxidant supplements may hinder beneficial training adaptations and are generally not recommended [[C34. Antioxidants]].

**Timing:** While the post-exercise "anabolic window" is more flexible than previously thought, timely intake (within ~2 hours) of carbohydrates and protein remains beneficial, particularly when recovery time between sessions is short (<8 hours) [[C3. Nutrient Timing]].

**Practical Applications:** Recovery meals/snacks should ideally combine carbohydrates and protein (e.g., chocolate milk, Greek yogurt with fruit and granola, chicken stir-fry with rice, smoothie with protein powder and fruit). Prioritize sleep [[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]] and overall adequate daily energy and nutrient intake alongside targeted post-exercise nutrition.
