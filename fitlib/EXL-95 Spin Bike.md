### **EXL-95: Spin Bike**

**ID:** EXL-95-CARDIO-SPINBIKE **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A type of indoor stationary bike [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] designed to more closely mimic the feel and geometry of a road bicycle [[X2. Cycling (Road, Mountain, Track)]]. Features a weighted flywheel, adjustable resistance (often manual friction or magnetic), and allows riders to stand up while pedaling. Commonly used in group fitness classes ("Spinning").

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (intensity highly adjustable).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Resistance [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Cadence (RPM) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Incorporate Standing Climbs.
- Perform High-Intensity Intervals [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].
- Follow structured classes/programs.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Resistance.
- Decrease Cadence.
- Decrease Duration.
- Remain seated instead of standing.
- Use Upright [[EXL-93 Stationary Bike (Upright)]] or Recumbent Bike [[EXL-94 Stationary Bike (Recumbent)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes (especially when standing/climbing), Calves.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]] (especially when standing or performing high intensity intervals).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height (slight knee bend at bottom), seat fore/aft position, and handlebar height/reach for comfortable and efficient posture (similar to road bike fit).
- **Execution:** Pedal smoothly. Maintain good posture (slight hinge at hips, neutral spine, relaxed shoulders). Engage core. Apply resistance as needed. For standing climbs, shift weight slightly forward, maintain smooth pedal stroke, keep core engaged.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing appropriate for intensity.
- **Common Faults:** Poor setup leading to discomfort/inefficiency, excessive bouncing when standing, insufficient resistance allowing flywheel momentum to dominate, poor posture.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee, hip, or back injuries. Standing climbs increase stress on joints. Check with instructor/professional if unsure about suitability.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper bike fit before starting. Start with lower resistance/cadence to warm up. Gradually increase intensity. If standing, maintain control and avoid bouncing excessively. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]]. Be aware that flywheel continues spinning when stopping abruptly (unless fixed gear).

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Resistance Level (may be subjective or measured in watts/levels), Cadence (RPM), Distance (estimated) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Power Output (Watts) - available on many modern spin bikes.
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
