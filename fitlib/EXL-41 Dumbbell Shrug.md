### **EXL-41: Dumbbell Shrug**

**ID:** EXL-41-DB-SHRUG **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the upper trapezius muscles, involving elevating the shoulders (shrugging) while holding dumbbells at the sides. Allows for a potentially more natural arm path than the barbell version.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause and squeeze at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Barbell Shrugs [[EXL-16 Barbell Shrug]].
- Trap Bar Shrugs.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Focus on compound lifts involving traps (e.g., Deadlifts [[EXL-03 Barbell Conventional Deadlift]], Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]]).
- Bodyweight shoulder elevation exercises.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Upper Trapezius, Levator Scapulae.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Middle Trapezius, Rhomboids (slight involvement).
- **Stabilizers:** Forearm flexors (grip), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand upright with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells at sides with palms facing body (neutral grip). Arms fully extended. Maintain upright posture, chest up, shoulders relaxed down initially.
- **Execution:** Without bending elbows, elevate shoulders straight up towards ears as high as possible, focusing on contracting the upper trapezius. Imagine trying to touch ears with shoulders. Pause briefly at the peak contraction. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control, allowing shoulders to depress fully. Avoid rolling shoulders forward or backward.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during shrug (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rolling shoulders forward/backward, bending elbows, using momentum, insufficient range of motion.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute neck or shoulder injuries (impingement, nerve issues). Ensure proper posture to avoid neck strain.
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight allowing full range of motion without momentum. Control the weight. Avoid jerking movements.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (vertical shrug motion, full ROM, minimal momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
