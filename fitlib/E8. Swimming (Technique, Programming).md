### E8. Swimming (Technique, Programming)
**ID:** E8-SWIMMING

Swimming is a full-body, low-impact cardiovascular exercise performed in water, requiring specific techniques for propulsion and efficiency.

**Major Strokes:** Freestyle (Front Crawl), Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly.

**Technique Fundamentals:**
- **Body Position (Streamlining):** Horizontal, high position to minimize drag. Core engagement crucial.
- **Breathing:** Rhythmic, coordinated with stroke.
- **Pull/Catch:** Effective hand/forearm propulsion (High Elbow Catch/EVF).
- **Kick:** Propulsion and stabilization (Flutter, Dolphin, Whip).
- **Rotation:** Body roll (Freestyle/Backstroke) for reach/power.

**Programming Components:**
- **Technique Work/Drills:** Essential for efficiency.
- **Volume:** Measured in distance (meters/yards). Gradual increase for base building.
- **Intensity:** Prescribed via pace times, RPE, or HR (less reliable).
- **Interval Training ([[E4. Interval Training (General)]]):** Common structure targeting different energy systems/paces.
- **Endurance Sets:** Longer swims or sets with short rest ([[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]]).
- **Dry-Land Training:** Strength/conditioning supports performance/injury prevention (core, shoulders, back - [[X3.1. Dry-Land Training for Swimmers]]).

**Considerations:** High technical barrier. Requires pool access. Low impact, minimal bone density stimulus.
