### IX-6. Exercise Contraindications
**ID:** IX-6-CONTRAINDICATIONS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Exercise contraindications are specific medical conditions or clinical situations where the potential risks of performing exercise outweigh the potential benefits. Recognizing these is crucial for safety. Contraindications can be absolute (exercise should not be performed) or relative (caution required, exercise may be possible with modification/supervision). Assessment by a qualified healthcare professional is necessary.

**Absolute Contraindications (Exercise Should Generally Not Be Performed Until Condition Stabilized/Treated):**
- Recent significant change in resting ECG suggesting ischemia, recent myocardial infarction (within 2 days), or other acute cardiac event.
- Unstable angina.
- Uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise.
- Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.
- Uncontrolled symptomatic heart failure.
- Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction.
- Acute myocarditis or pericarditis.
- Suspected or known dissecting aneurysm.
- Acute systemic infection, accompanied by fever, body aches, or swollen lymph glands.

**Relative Contraindications (Exercise May Be Possible with Caution, Evaluation, Modification, Supervision):**
- Left main coronary artery stenosis.
- Moderate stenotic valvular heart disease.
- Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).
- Severe arterial hypertension (e.g., systolic BP >200 mmHg or diastolic BP >110 mmHg at rest).
- Tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias.
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other outflow tract obstructions.
- High-degree atrioventricular block.
- Ventricular aneurysm.
- Uncontrolled metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes, thyrotoxicosis).
- Chronic infectious disease (e.g., HIV).
- Mental or physical impairment leading to inability to exercise adequately.
- Advanced pregnancy (requires specific guidance - [[G1. Exercise During Pregnancy]]).

**Implications:**
- Pre-participation screening (related to identifying risk) is essential to identify individuals with potential contraindications.
- Individuals with relative contraindications require careful evaluation by a physician to determine appropriate exercise type, intensity, duration, frequency, and necessary monitoring/supervision.
- Fitness professionals must operate within their scope of practice ([[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching]]) and refer clients with potential contraindications to healthcare providers for clearance and guidance.
