**ID:** C20-SUPPLEMENTS-OVERVIEW **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Dietary supplements are products intended to augment the diet. They contain ingredients like vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, or metabolites. While some can offer performance or health benefits in specific contexts, their use requires careful evaluation due to variable efficacy, safety, quality control, and legality [].

**Evaluation Framework (Need, Efficacy, Safety, Legality/Permissibility - NESP Framework):** Before using any supplement, consider:

1. **Need:** Is there a genuine need based on dietary assessment, confirmed deficiency (e.g., iron, Vit D), or a specific, evidence-supported performance goal that cannot be met through diet alone? A "food-first" approach is paramount [].
2. **Efficacy:** Is there robust, high-quality scientific evidence (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, multiple well-designed RCTs in relevant populations) demonstrating the supplement is effective for the intended purpose at the proposed dose? []. Many supplements lack strong evidence despite marketing claims [[J3. Misinformation in Fitness]].
3. **Safety:** Are there potential short-term or long-term side effects? What is the safe dosage range? Are there interactions with medications or other supplements? []. Consider potential contaminants [[C23. Supplement Safety, Regulation, and Quality Control]].
4. **Permissibility (Legality):** Is the supplement and all its ingredients permitted by relevant sporting organizations (e.g., WADA)? Athletes are subject to strict liability []. Check ingredients against the WADA Prohibited List.

**Evidence-Based Categorization (e.g., AIS / IOC Models):** Supplements are often categorized based on the level of scientific evidence:

- **Group A (Proven):** Strong evidence for benefit in specific situations when used appropriately. Examples: Caffeine, Creatine, Beta-Alanine, Bicarbonate, Nitrate, Vitamin D & Iron (if deficient), Sports Drinks/Gels/Foods []. See [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]].
- **Group B (Emerging/Investigational):** Limited or emerging evidence suggesting potential benefits, but require more research. Use considered on case-by-case basis with careful monitoring. Examples: Omega-3s, Collagen, Probiotics, Curcumin, HMB, Citrulline []. See [[C22. Supplements with LimitedMixed Evidence (Group B)]].
- **Group C (Unproven/Disproven):** Little to no credible evidence of benefit, or evidence shows lack of effect. Not recommended.
- **Group D (Banned/High Risk):** Prohibited substances or products with high risk of containing them. Should not be used [].

**Quality Assurance:**

- Due to regulation gaps, contamination with undeclared ingredients (including banned substances) is a significant risk [[C23. Supplement Safety, Regulation, and Quality Control]].
- Minimize risk by choosing products certified by independent third-party testing programs (e.g., NSF Certified for Sport®, Informed Sport, BSCG) []. This reduces, but does not eliminate, risk.

**Important Considerations:**

- Supplements cannot replace a well-planned diet, structured training, and adequate recovery [[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]], [[M. Recovery Strategies]].
- Consult qualified professionals (sports dietitian, physician) before initiating supplement use.
- Be critical of marketing claims and anecdotal evidence [[J3. Misinformation in Fitness]].
