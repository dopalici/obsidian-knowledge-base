### **EXL-96: Rowing Ergometer (Rower)**

**ID:** EXL-96-CARDIO-ROWER **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An indoor exercise machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] that simulates the motion of on-water rowing [[E9. Rowing (Ergometer)]]. Provides a full-body, low-impact workout engaging legs, core, and back, excellent for cardiovascular and muscular endurance.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (intensity controlled by effort/pace). Technique is crucial.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Pace (Decrease time/500m or Increase Watts) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration or Distance [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Stroke Rate (SPM) - use appropriately, power per stroke is key.
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]] / [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].
- Focus on improving technique for better efficiency.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Pace / Exertion Level.
- Decrease Duration or Distance.
- Focus on technique drills at low intensity.
- Break workouts into smaller intervals.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings (drive phase); Lats, Rhomboids, Traps, Biceps, Erector Spinae (pull phase); Core musculature (throughout) [[L4. Core Stability Training]]. Considered a true full-body workout.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[E9. Rowing (Ergometer)]], [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]] (Core/Spine Principles)

- **Stroke Cycle:** Order is critical: Legs -> Core -> Arms (Drive); Arms -> Core -> Legs (Recovery).
    - **Catch:** Shins vertical, arms straight, slight forward lean from hips, core braced, lats engaged.
    - **Drive:** Initiate by powerfully extending legs. Once legs are nearly straight, swing torso back slightly (hinge from hips). Finish by pulling handle towards lower ribs/sternum with arms.
    - **Finish:** Legs fully extended, slight backward lean (~11 o'clock position), handle pulled in, core braced.
    - **Recovery:** Extend arms forward first. Then hinge forward from hips. Finally, bend knees to slide seat forward back to catch position. Smooth and controlled.
- **Breathing:** Typically exhale during drive, inhale during recovery.
- **Common Faults:** Pulling with arms first, opening back too early (lumbar strain risk), shooting the slide (legs extend without torso moving), poor posture (rounding back), incomplete strokes (short reach or pull).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injuries (especially disc issues, requires strict form), acute knee or shoulder injuries. Proper technique is vital to prevent back strain.
- **Safety:** Learn proper technique first. Start with lower intensity/duration. Maintain neutral spine during drive/recovery hinge. Ensure feet are securely strapped. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Time for specific distances (e.g., 500m, 2000m, 5k) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Average Pace (time/500m), Power (Watts), Stroke Rate (SPM).
- Duration or Distance rowed.
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
