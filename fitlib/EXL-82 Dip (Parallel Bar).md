### **EXL-82: Dip (Parallel Bar)**

**ID:** EXL-82-BW-DIP **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** A fundamental bodyweight upper-body pressing exercise [[B7. Bodyweight Training]] performed between parallel bars, involving lowering the body by bending the elbows and pressing back up. Primarily targets the triceps, chest, and anterior shoulders.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires significant upper body strength).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Add External Load (Weight Belt/Vest) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at bottom).
- Ring Dips (increases instability and difficulty [[X9. Gymnastics  Calisthenics]]).
- Forward Lean Dip (emphasizes chest more).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Assisted Dip Machine [[EXL-65 Assisted Pull-upDip Machine]].
- Band Assisted Dips [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Negative Dips (focus only on controlled lowering/eccentric).
- Bench Dips (feet supported on floor or another bench).
- Push-ups [[EXL-83 Push-up (Standard & Variations)]].
- Triceps Pushdowns [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii, Pectoralis Major (sternal portion), Anterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Serratus Anterior, Pectoralis Minor, Rhomboids, Latissimus Dorsi, Levator Scapulae.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Grasp parallel bars with neutral grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Jump or push up to support bodyweight with arms fully extended (slight elbow bend). Keep shoulders depressed (down away from ears). Torso can be upright (more triceps focus) or leaned slightly forward (more chest focus). Cross legs or keep them straight down.
- **Execution:** Inhale and slowly lower body by bending elbows. Keep elbows tucked relatively close to body (don't flare out excessively). Lower until upper arms are approximately parallel to floor or a comfortable stretch is felt in chest/shoulders (typically ~90-degree elbow bend). Avoid letting shoulders roll forward excessively. Exhale and press forcefully back up to starting position by extending elbows.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent (eccentric), exhale during press (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Shoulders elevating/rolling forward, excessive elbow flare, insufficient range of motion (too shallow), swinging/using momentum, lowering too quickly.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, AC joint), elbow or wrist pain. Can be stressful on shoulder joint, especially at bottom position if depth is excessive or form is poor. Individuals with poor shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]] should be cautious.
- **Safety:** Ensure adequate strength and stability before attempting unassisted dips. Control the descent. Avoid excessive depth if it causes pain. Ensure bars are stable.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max reps performed (bodyweight or with added load) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Load added/assistance level used for specific reps/sets.
- Qualitative assessment of form (depth, shoulder position, control) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
