### A4. Micronutrients
**ID:** A4-MICRONUTRIENTS
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Vitamins (organic) and minerals (inorganic) required in small amounts for numerous physiological functions, acting as coenzymes, catalysts, and structural components. Deficiencies can impair health and performance. Needs may increase with high training volume or sweat losses.

**Key Vitamins:**
- **Fat-Soluble (A, D, E, K):** Stored in body fat. Require fat for absorption. Vitamin D crucial for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, muscle function. Vitamin E key antioxidant. Vitamin K involved in clotting/bone.
- **Water-Soluble (B Complex, C):** Not stored significantly (except B12). B Vitamins crucial for energy metabolism. Vitamin C antioxidant, collagen synthesis, immune function.

**Key Minerals:**
- **Major Minerals (>100mg/day):** Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride (electrolytes).
- **Trace Minerals (<100mg/day):** Iron (oxygen transport), Zinc (immunity, enzymes), Iodine (thyroid), Selenium (antioxidant), Copper (iron metabolism).

**Considerations for Athletes:** Increased needs possible (Iron, Ca, Vit D, Zn, Mg, B Vits). Sweat increases electrolyte needs ([[C5. Electrolytes]]). High-dose antioxidant supplements may blunt adaptations ([[C34. Antioxidants]]). Food-first approach recommended; supplement only if deficient ([[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]]).
