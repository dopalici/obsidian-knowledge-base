**ID:** C15-LOW-CARB-DIETS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) encompass a range of eating patterns characterized by reduced carbohydrate intake compared to typical dietary guidelines, generally falling below 40-45% of total calories or often below 130-150g per day. This category is broader and less restrictive than very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD or Keto) [[C13. Ketogenic Diet]].

**Characteristics:**

- Carbohydrate intake reduced, often replaced with higher proportions of protein [[C16. High-Protein Diets]] and/or fat [[A3. Macronutrients]].
- Emphasis often placed on non-starchy vegetables, protein sources, and healthy fats.
- Limits or excludes high-carbohydrate foods like grains, sugars, starchy vegetables, and many fruits, depending on the specific carbohydrate threshold.
- Does not necessarily induce or maintain nutritional ketosis.

**Proposed Benefits & Rationale:**

- **Weight Loss:** Can be an effective strategy, primarily by facilitating a caloric deficit [[A1. Energy Balance]] through reduced food choices, increased satiety from protein/fat, and potentially reduced appetite. Initial weight loss often includes water weight due to glycogen depletion. Long-term effectiveness is comparable to other energy-restricted diets when calories and protein are matched [].
- **Glycemic Control:** Can be particularly effective for improving blood sugar management in individuals with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Factors:** May improve triglyceride levels and HDL cholesterol, but effects on LDL cholesterol are variable and depend on fat quality/quantity.

**Fitness & Performance Considerations:**

- **High-Intensity Performance:** Reducing carbohydrate availability can impair performance in activities heavily reliant on glycolysis (>LT2 intensity) due to reduced muscle glycogen stores [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]. Effects may be less pronounced than with ketogenic diets, depending on the degree of restriction, but still a significant consideration for many athletes [[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]], [[C28. Nutrition for Strength Power Athletes]].
- **Endurance Performance (Lower Intensity):** Less likely to negatively impact performance during lower-intensity, aerobic activities where fat oxidation plays a larger role.
- **Strength & Muscle Gain:** Can support strength maintenance or gains if protein [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]] and total calories [[C1. Caloric Targets for Different Goals]] are adequate, but may not be optimal for maximizing performance or hypertrophy [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]] due to potential impacts on training intensity and glycogen availability.
- **Adaptation:** May require an adaptation period.

**Sustainability:** Adherence can vary. Some find the restriction challenging long-term, while others prefer the food choices and satiety effects.
