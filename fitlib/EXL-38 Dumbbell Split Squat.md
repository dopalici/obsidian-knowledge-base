### **EXL-38: Dumbbell Split Squat**

**ID:** EXL-38-DB-SPLITSQUAT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A unilateral lower-body exercise performed in a static staggered stance (one foot forward, one foot back), involving lowering the hips until the back knee nears the floor, while holding dumbbells. Primarily targets the quads and glutes of the front leg, while enhancing stability and balance.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires more balance than bilateral squats, but less than dynamic lunges).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Elevate Rear Foot (Bulgarian Split Squat - increases ROM and load on front leg).
- Elevate Front Foot (increases ROM, potentially more glute focus).
- Progress to dynamic lunges [[EXL-36 Dumbbell Lunge (StaticAlternatingWalking)]] or Barbell Split Squat / Lunge [[EXL-15 Barbell Lunge]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Bodyweight [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Use support for balance (e.g., hold onto rack).
- Reduce Range of Motion (don't descend as deep).
- Static Lunges (can be similar, often used interchangeably but split squat implies fixed stance).
- Bilateral Squat variations [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]], [[EXL-39 Dumbbell Goblet Squat]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps (front leg), Gluteus Maximus (front leg).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings (front leg), Adductor Magnus, Gluteus Medius/Minimus (hip stability). Hip flexors of back leg get stretched.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Calves, Foot/Ankle stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand holding dumbbells at sides. Step one foot forward and the other foot backward into a staggered stance (long enough so front heel stays down and back knee can lower towards floor). Distribute weight primarily on front foot, use back foot mainly for balance. Maintain upright torso, core engaged.
- **Execution:** Inhale and lower hips straight down under control, bending both knees until the back knee lightly touches or hovers just above the floor. Front knee should track over the front foot (avoid excessive forward travel or valgus collapse). Maintain upright posture. Exhale and drive forcefully through the front foot (heel/mid-foot) to return to starting position. Complete all reps on one side before switching.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Front knee collapsing inward, torso leaning too far forward, pushing heavily off back foot, insufficient depth, poor balance.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries. May be better tolerated than dynamic lunges for some knee issues. Balance impairments require caution or support.
- **Safety:** Ensure stable stance. Control the movement, especially the descent. Master bodyweight version first.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load or bodyweight.
- Qualitative assessment of form (depth, knee tracking, torso position, balance) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
