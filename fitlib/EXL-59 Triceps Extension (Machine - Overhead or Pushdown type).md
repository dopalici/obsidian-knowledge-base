### **EXL-59: Triceps Extension (Machine - Overhead or Pushdown type)**

**ID:** EXL-59-MEX-TRIEXT **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] targeting the triceps brachii. Machines typically replicate either an overhead extension or a pushdown motion.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Arm Variations (if machine allows).
- Progress to free weight triceps exercises: Dumbbell Overhead Extensions [[EXL-35 Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)]], Skullcrushers [[EXL-13 Barbell Skullcrusher (Lying Triceps Extension)]], Close-Grip Bench Press [[EXL-02 Barbell Bench Press (Flat)]].
- Cable Triceps Pushdowns [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]] / Overhead Extensions [[EXL-68 Cable Overhead Triceps Extension (RopeBar)]]

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Pushdowns / Overhead Extensions [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Bodyweight Dips (Bench Dips) [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (all heads; overhead variations emphasize long head more).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Pushdown Type Example):** Adjust seat/pads as needed. Sit securely, back supported. Grip handles (various grips often available). Start with elbows bent. Keep upper arms stable and close to body (or overhead for that variation).
- **Setup (Overhead Type Example):** Sit securely, back supported. Grip handles overhead, elbows bent. Keep upper arms stable near head.
- **Execution:** Exhale and extend elbows fully, pressing against the resistance. Focus on contracting the triceps. Keep upper arms stationary throughout movement. Pause briefly at full extension. Inhale and slowly return to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during extension (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Moving upper arms, using momentum, incomplete range of motion, flaring elbows excessively (pushdown type), shrugging shoulders.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow injuries (tendinopathy, etc.). Overhead variations require good shoulder mobility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]].
- **Safety:** Ensure proper machine setup. Control the weight. Avoid slamming stack. Keep upper arms stable.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
