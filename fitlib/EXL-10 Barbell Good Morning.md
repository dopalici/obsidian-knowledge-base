### **EXL-10: Barbell Good Morning**

**ID:** EXL-10-BB-GOODMORNING **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A hip hinge exercise performed with a barbell positioned across the upper back (similar to a squat), involving hinging at the hips to lower the torso towards parallel while maintaining a neutral spine and slightly bent knees. Primarily targets the spinal erectors, glutes, and hamstrings.

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Requires excellent hip hinge mechanics, hamstring flexibility, and ability to maintain spinal neutrality under load placed further up the kinetic chain). High potential for injury if performed incorrectly.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]] (progress very cautiously).
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pauses).
- Seated Good Mornings (different feel, often less load).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Empty Bar.
- Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs) [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] (load held lower, generally safer starting point).
- Kettlebell Swings/Deadlifts [[B9. Kettlebell Training]].
- Back Extensions [[EXL-86 Back Extension  Hyperextension (Bench)]].
- Improve hip hinge [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]], hamstring flexibility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]], and core stability [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Erector Spinae (strong isometric & eccentric focus), Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature, Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids - supporting bar), Latissimus Dorsi. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Place barbell across upper back (similar to high bar or low bar squat [[EXL-01 Barbell Back Squat (High Bar & Low Bar)]]). Stand with feet hip-to-shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent. Maintain neutral spine, chest up, shoulders pulled back slightly. Brace core tightly.
- **Execution:** Initiate movement by pushing hips backward (hinging at the hip [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]), lowering torso towards parallel to the floor. Keep back perfectly straight/neutral throughout. Maintain slight bend in knees (similar to RDL). Lower as far as flexibility allows _while maintaining neutral spine_. Feel stretch in hamstrings. Drive hips forward forcefully to return to starting upright position, squeezing glutes and spinal erectors.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering/hinge (eccentric), exhale during hip extension (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rounding the lower or upper back (VERY DANGEROUS under load), bending knees excessively, initiating movement with spinal flexion, losing core brace.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Low back pain/injury (especially disc issues or conditions aggravated by shear forces), limited hamstring flexibility, poor hip hinge mechanics. High risk exercise if performed incorrectly [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** MUST prioritize neutral spine. Start with extremely light weight or empty bar to master the movement pattern. Progress load very conservatively. Ensure adequate hamstring flexibility. If unsure, stick to RDLs or Back Extensions.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets (use caution with load progression) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (spinal neutrality throughout ROM, hip hinge quality).
