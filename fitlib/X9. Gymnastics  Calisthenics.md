\*\*Created:\*\* 2025-04-24

Gymnastics and advanced calisthenics involve controlling one's bodyweight through complex movements requiring high levels of relative strength, power, flexibility, mobility, balance, coordination, and core stability.

\*\*Key Physical Demands:\*\*  
\- \*\*Relative Strength:\*\* Extremely high strength-to-weight ratio needed for skills like levers, planches, iron cross, handstand push-ups.  
\- \*\*Straight-Arm Strength:\*\* Significant strength required with arms straight or nearly straight (e.g., planche, iron cross, levers), placing high stress on connective tissues (elbows, shoulders).  
\- \*\*Core Strength & Stability:\*\* Exceptional core control needed to maintain body tension, alignment, and transfer force ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]).  
\- \*\*Mobility & Flexibility:\*\* High degree of flexibility required in shoulders, wrists, hips, hamstrings, spine for various skills ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).  
\- \*\*Balance & Proprioception:\*\* Essential for handstands, single-arm skills, ring work ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]).  
\- \*\*Coordination & Skill:\*\* Complex movements require precise timing, intermuscular coordination, and extensive motor learning ([[G-VII-3. Neurophysiology of Movement]]).  
\- \*\*Muscular Endurance:\*\* Ability to hold static positions or perform repeated movements.  
\- \*\*Power:\*\* Needed for dynamic skills like tumbling, vaulting, explosive movements on rings/bars.

\*\*Training Components:\*\*  
\- \*\*Skill Development:\*\* Progressive practice of specific gymnastics/calisthenics skills (handstands, levers, planches, muscle-ups, flags, tumbling). Breaking down complex skills into progressions.  
\- \*\*Strength Training:\*\*  
    \- \*Bodyweight Progressions:\* Utilizing leverage, ROM, tempo changes to increase difficulty of fundamental movements (push-ups, pull-ups, dips, rows, squats \- [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].  
    \- \*Weighted Calisthenics:\* Adding external load to bodyweight exercises (weighted pull-ups/dips).  
    \- \*Straight-Arm Strength Conditioning:\* Specific exercises targeting connective tissue preparation and strength in straight-arm positions (e.g., planche leans, support holds, skin-the-cats). Requires careful progression.  
    \- \*Core Training:\* Extensive focus on exercises developing high levels of tension and control (hollow body holds, L-sits, dragon flags).  
\- \*\*Flexibility & Mobility Training:\*\* Dedicated flexibility work (static, PNF) and mobility drills targeting specific requirements (pancake stretch, bridge, shoulder dislocates).  
\- \*\*Pre-habilitation / Injury Prevention:\*\* Focus on strengthening supporting muscles (rotator cuff, scapular stabilizers) and preparing connective tissues (wrists, elbows, shoulders) for high loads.

\*\*Considerations:\*\* High risk of overuse injuries (wrists, elbows, shoulders, back) if progression is too rapid or foundational strength/mobility/connective tissue preparation is inadequate. Requires significant time commitment and patience for skill development.
