### L4. Core Stability Training
**ID:** L4-CORE-STABILITY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Core stability refers to the ability to control the position and motion of the trunk (lumbo-pelvic-hip complex) over the pelvis and legs during movement, providing a stable base for limb actions and protecting the spine. It involves coordinated activation of deep and superficial core musculature.

**Core Musculature ([[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]]):**
- **Inner Unit (Deep Stabilizers):** Transverse Abdominis (TVA), Multifidus, Pelvic Floor, Diaphragm. Act like a corset, provide segmental stability, control intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).
- **Outer Unit (Superficial Movers/Stabilizers):** Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Erector Spinae, Quadratus Lumborum, Glutes, Latissimus Dorsi. Generate movement and contribute to overall trunk stiffness.

**Functions of Core Stability:**
- **Spinal Stabilization:** Protects spine from excessive load/shear during movement/lifting ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]).
- **Force Transfer:** Efficiently transfers forces between lower/upper extremities.
- **Foundation for Limb Movement:** Stable base for powerful actions.
- **Postural Control:** Contributes to maintaining upright posture ([[A15. Biomechanics Posture Analysis]]).

**Training Principles:** Focus on *resisting* unwanted spinal movement (anti-movement) rather than just generating movement (e.g., crunches). Train in multiple planes.
- **Anti-Extension:** Resisting lumbar hyperextension. Examples: Plank variations, Dead Bugs, Ab Wheel Rollouts.
- **Anti-Rotation:** Resisting trunk rotation. Examples: Pallof Press variations, Single-Arm Carries/Rows/Presses.
- **Anti-Lateral Flexion:** Resisting side bending. Examples: Side Plank variations, Suitcase Carries.
- **Integration:** Incorporate core stability demands into compound lifts and functional movements (bracing during squats/deadlifts, stabilizing during lunges/carries). Breathing/bracing techniques important.

**Considerations:** Traditional crunches primarily train spinal flexion, may not optimize functional stability or be ideal for back pain. Neutral spine focus often emphasized.
