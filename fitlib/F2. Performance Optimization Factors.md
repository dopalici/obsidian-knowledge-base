**ID:** F2-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION
**Created:** 2025-04-24 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Optimizing acute performance for a specific event, competition, or testing session involves strategically manipulating several factors beyond chronic training adaptations to ensure the athlete is physiologically and psychologically primed on the day.

**Key Optimization Factors & Strategies:**
1.  **Warm-up Protocols:** A structured warm-up aims to increase core/muscle temperature, enhance metabolic rate, improve neuromuscular activation/coordination, increase ROM, and mentally prepare the athlete.
    - *RAMP Protocol (Jeffreys):* Raise (general aerobic activity, increase temp/HR), Activate (key muscles involved), Mobilize (dynamic stretching/mobility for relevant joints - [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]), Potentiate (progressively intense, specific movements mimicking activity, potentially including Post-Activation Potentiation - PAP).
    - *PAP:* A brief, near-maximal voluntary contraction (e.g., heavy squat) followed by short rest (~3-10 min) may acutely enhance subsequent explosive performance (e.g., jump height, sprint speed) via neural mechanisms (increased motor unit excitability). Effect is individual, timing-dependent, best suited for power events.
    - *Avoid Prolonged Static Stretching:* Can acutely decrease maximal force/power output if performed immediately before activity. Dynamic stretching preferred pre-event. ([McGowan et al., 2015]).
2.  **Tapering:** The systematic reduction of training load (primarily volume, while maintaining or slightly reducing intensity/frequency) during the final days/weeks before a major competition. Aims to dissipate accumulated fatigue while retaining/enhancing fitness adaptations, leading to performance supercompensation.
    - *Duration:* Typically 4-28 days, depending on sport, training load, individual recovery.
    - *Volume Reduction:* Significant reduction (40-70%+) is key.
    - *Intensity/Frequency:* Generally maintained or slightly reduced to retain adaptations and feel sharp.
    - *Expected Outcome:* Performance improvements typically ~0.5-6% ([Mujika & Padilla, 2003]). ([[K2. Advanced Periodization Strategies]]).
3.  **Psychological Preparation:** Utilizing mental skills to achieve optimal mental state for performance ([[K3. Psychological Aspects of Elite Performance]]).
    - *Pre-Performance Routines:* Consistent, individualized sequences to manage arousal, focus attention, build confidence immediately before event.
    - *Arousal Control:* Techniques to manage anxiety (breathing, relaxation) or increase activation (psych-up) to reach optimal zone (IZOF).
    - *Mental Imagery/Visualization:* Rehearsing successful performance and coping strategies.
    - *Positive Self-Talk:* Using constructive internal dialogue.
4.  **Environmental Adaptation/Acclimatization:** Specific preparation for challenging environments reduces physiological strain and performance decrements.
    - *Heat Acclimatization:* 7-14+ days of training in heat improves thermoregulation ([[A27. Thermoregulation During Exercise]]). Pre-cooling strategies (e.g., ice vests) may offer acute benefit.
    - *Altitude Acclimatization:* Gradual ascent over days/weeks allows physiological adaptations to hypoxia. "Live High, Train Low" strategies sometimes used.
5.  **Pacing Strategies:** Critical for endurance events. Requires understanding physiological limits (e.g., threshold power/pace - [[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]) and practicing different strategies (even split, negative split, variable) to optimize energy distribution and avoid premature fatigue. Requires experience and feedback ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]).
6.  **Acute Recovery (Between Heats/Events):** Strategies like active recovery, cooling, massage, compression may aid short-term recovery during multi-stage competitions, though evidence varies ([[M1. Recovery Modalities Evidence and Application]]). Nutritional replenishment crucial.
7.  **Technical Efficiency/Movement Economy:** Refined, efficient technique minimizes energy expenditure at a given workload, conserving energy for later stages or allowing higher intensity output. Requires extensive deliberate practice ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]], [[E6. Running (Technique, Programming)]], etc.).
8.  **Nutritional Peaking Strategies:**
    - *Carbohydrate Loading:* Maximizing glycogen stores for endurance events >90 min ([[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]).
    - *Pre-Event Meal:* Timed appropriately, focusing on familiar, easily digestible carbs/protein ([[C5. Pre, During, and Post-Exercise Nutrition]]).
    - *Hydration Status:* Ensuring euhydration before event start ([[C4. Hydration]]).
    - *Acute Ergogenic Aids:* Strategic use of proven supplements like caffeine or sodium bicarbonate timed appropriately before event ([[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]).
