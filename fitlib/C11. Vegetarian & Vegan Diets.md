**ID:** C11-VEGETARIAN-VEGAN-DIETS **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Vegetarian and vegan diets involve excluding animal flesh and, in the case of veganism, all animal-derived products. Well-planned versions can meet nutritional needs, support health and athletic performance, but require specific attention to potential nutrient shortfalls [].

**Definitions:**

- **Vegetarian:** Excludes meat, poultry, fish. Subtypes exist:
    - _Lacto-ovo-vegetarian:_ Includes dairy and eggs.
    - _Lacto-vegetarian:_ Includes dairy, excludes eggs.
    - _Ovo-vegetarian:_ Includes eggs, excludes dairy.
- **Vegan:** Excludes all animal products (meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, often honey). Relies entirely on plant-based foods.

**Potential Health Benefits:**

- Associated with lower risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain cancers, and often lower BMI/obesity rates.
- Typically higher intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, resulting in higher fiber, lower saturated fat, and higher phytonutrient intake [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]].

**Key Nutrient Considerations (Especially for Vegans):**

- **Vitamin B12:** Crucial. Found reliably only in animal products or fortified foods/supplements. **Mandatory supplementation or consistent intake of fortified foods is essential for vegans** to prevent deficiency, which causes irreversible neurological damage [].
- **Iron:** Plant-based (non-heme) iron is less bioavailable than heme iron. Needs may be higher (~1.8x RDA). Optimize absorption by pairing iron sources with Vitamin C; avoid inhibitors like tannins (tea/coffee) and high-dose calcium with meals. Monitor status [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
- **Zinc:** Bioavailability reduced by phytates in plant foods. Soaking, sprouting, fermenting legumes/grains can improve absorption. Ensure adequate intake from nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains.
- **Calcium:** Ensure adequate intake from fortified plant milks/yogurts/tofu, leafy greens (low-oxalate like kale, collards), almonds, tahini.
- **Vitamin D:** Sources similar to general population (sunlight, fortified foods, supplements). Monitor status [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]].
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA):** Primarily found in fish. Plant sources (flax, chia, hemp, walnuts) provide ALA, but conversion to EPA/DHA is typically inefficient. Consider direct EPA/DHA from algal oil supplements [].
- **Iodine:** Can be low if not using iodized salt or consuming seaweed.
- **Protein:** Can be adequately met by consuming a variety of plant sources (legumes, soy products like tofu/tempeh, seitan, nuts, seeds, whole grains) throughout the day to obtain all essential amino acids [[A3. Macronutrients]]. Total protein needs might be slightly higher (~10%) due to potentially lower digestibility of some plant proteins [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]].

**Athletic Performance:**

- Well-planned vegetarian/vegan diets can support athletic performance at all levels []. No significant differences in performance metrics like endurance or strength typically observed compared to omnivores when energy and key nutrients (protein, iron, B12) are matched [[].
- Creatine intake from diet is negligible; supplementation [[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]] is likely beneficial for strength/power performance.
- Careful planning is needed to meet high energy and protein needs, particularly for strength/hypertrophy goals [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]].
