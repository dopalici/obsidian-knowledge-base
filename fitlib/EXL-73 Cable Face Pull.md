### **EXL-73: Cable Face Pull**

**ID:** EXL-73-CEX-FACEPULL **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An exercise using a high pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] with a rope attachment, involving pulling the rope towards the face while externally rotating the shoulders. Primarily targets the rear deltoids, rotator cuff muscles, and upper back scapular retractors, promoting shoulder health and posture.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Requires good control and focus on external rotation).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at peak contraction/external rotation, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Vary Stance (Standing, kneeling, half-kneeling).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Face Pulls / Pull-Aparts [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Dumbbell Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise [[EXL-26 Dumbbell Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise]].
- Machine Rear Delt Fly [[EXL-55 Rear Delt Fly  Reverse Pec Deck (Machine)]].
- Focus on scapular retraction exercises.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Posterior Deltoid, External Rotators (Infraspinatus, Teres Minor), Trapezius (Middle & Lower), Rhomboids.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Medial Deltoid, Biceps Brachii (minor role).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Erector Spinae, Rotator Cuff (overall stability).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach a rope handle to a high pulley cable. Grasp rope ends with overhand or neutral grip. Step back until arms are extended, maintaining slight tension on cable. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, slight knee bend, core engaged (or use kneeling/half-kneeling stance).
- **Execution:** Initiate by retracting scapulae slightly. Pull rope towards face, leading with hands and aiming to bring center of rope towards nose/forehead level. Simultaneously externally rotate shoulders so knuckles point towards ceiling and elbows flare outwards and slightly down at the end position (imagine a "double bicep pose" finish). Squeeze upper back and rear deltoids. Pause briefly. Slowly return rope to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during pull (concentric), inhale during return (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pulling too low (towards chest, like a row), insufficient external rotation (elbows stay low), shrugging shoulders excessively, using momentum/leaning back, forward head posture.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). Requires careful control to avoid aggravating shoulder joint. Start light.
- **Safety:** Focus on quality of movement, especially external rotation and scapular retraction, rather than heavy weight. Control the eccentric phase.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (external rotation, scapular control, pull height, minimal momentum) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
