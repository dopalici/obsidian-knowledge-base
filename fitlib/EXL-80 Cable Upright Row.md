### **EXL-80: Cable Upright Row**

**ID:** EXL-80-CEX-UPRIGHTROW **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] and typically a straight bar or EZ-bar attachment, involving pulling the bar vertically upwards towards the chin. Primarily targets the side deltoids and upper trapezius. _Note: Can be controversial due to potential shoulder impingement risk._

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires careful technique to minimize shoulder risk).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Dumbbell Upright Row (allows more freedom of movement).
- Barbell Upright Row (potentially higher load, also higher impingement risk).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Use wider grip (reduces internal rotation and potential impingement).
- Pull only to lower chest height instead of chin height.
- Focus on Lateral Raises [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]] / [[EXL-53 Lateral Raise (Machine)]] / [[EXL-71 Cable Lateral Raise]].
- Focus on Shrugs [[EXL-16 Barbell Shrug]] / [[EXL-41 Dumbbell Shrug]].
- Resistance Band Upright Row [[B11. Resistance Bands]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Medial Deltoid, Upper Trapezius.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Supraspinatus, Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, Brachioradialis, Levator Scapulae.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach straight bar or EZ-bar to low pulley cable. Stand close to machine, grasp bar with overhand grip, hands close together (typically 6-12 inches apart). Stand upright, core engaged, arms extended down.
- **Execution:** Exhale and pull bar vertically upwards towards chin, leading with elbows. Keep bar close to body. Elbows should travel outwards and upwards, ending higher than wrists at the top position. Pause briefly. Inhale and slowly lower bar back to starting position under control. _Focus on pulling with shoulders/traps, not just arms._
- **Breathing:** Exhale during upward pull (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Pulling primarily with arms/biceps, letting wrists go higher than elbows, pulling bar too far from body, using excessive momentum/body swing, shrugging without sufficient abduction.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Shoulder impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, AC joint issues. The combination of abduction and internal rotation can exacerbate impingement in susceptible individuals. **Perform with caution and prioritize shoulder health.** Using a wider grip and/or stopping the pull lower (e.g., chest height) can reduce risk. If pain occurs, discontinue and choose alternatives.
- **Safety:** Use strict form, minimize momentum. Keep bar close to body. Lead with elbows. Consider wider grip or alternative exercises if shoulder discomfort arises.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (leading with elbows, control, minimal momentum, pain-free ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
