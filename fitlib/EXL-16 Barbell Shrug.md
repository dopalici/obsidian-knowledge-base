### **EXL-16: Barbell Shrug**

**ID:** EXL-16-BB-SHRUG **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the upper trapezius muscles, involving elevating the shoulders (shrugging) while holding a loaded barbell in front of the body.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause and squeeze at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Dumbbell Shrugs [[EXL-41 Dumbbell Shrug]].
- Behind-the-Back Barbell Shrugs (different angle).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell Shrugs [[EXL-41 Dumbbell Shrug]] (may allow more natural movement).
- Focus on compound lifts involving traps (e.g., Deadlifts [[EXL-03 Barbell Conventional Deadlift]], Rows [[EXL-06 Barbell Bent-Over Row (Pronated Grip)]], Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]]).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Upper Trapezius, Levator Scapulae.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Middle Trapezius, Rhomboids (slight involvement).
- **Stabilizers:** Forearm flexors (grip), Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Rotator Cuff. [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding barbell with overhand grip (pronated) slightly wider than shoulders, arms fully extended in front of thighs. Maintain upright posture, chest up, shoulders relaxed down initially.
- **Execution:** Without bending elbows, elevate shoulders straight up towards ears as high as possible, focusing on contracting the upper trapezius. Pause briefly at the peak contraction. Lower the barbell back to the starting position under control, allowing shoulders to depress fully. Avoid rolling shoulders forward or backward.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during shrug (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rolling shoulders forward/backward, bending elbows, using momentum, insufficient range of motion (not fully elevating or depressing shoulders).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute neck or shoulder injuries (impingement, nerve issues). Ensure proper posture to avoid neck strain [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight allowing full range of motion without momentum. Control the weight. Avoid jerking movements. Straps may be needed for grip with very heavy loads but limit grip strength development.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (vertical shrug motion, full ROM, minimal momentum).
