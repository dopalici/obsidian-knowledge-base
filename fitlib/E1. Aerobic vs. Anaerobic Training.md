### E1. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Training
**ID:** E1-AEROBIC-ANAEROBIC
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Training can be broadly categorized based on the primary energy system stressed ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]).

**Aerobic Training ("Cardio"):**
- **Definition:** Exercise performed at an intensity where the oxidative system (related to [[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]) is the primary supplier of ATP, utilizing oxygen. Typically sustainable for extended periods (>2-3 minutes).
- **Intensity:** Low to moderate (e.g., < LT2/MLSS, Zone 1-4 HR).
- **Examples:** Long distance running/cycling/swimming, brisk walking, [[E2. Steady-State Cardio (LISS - Low-Intensity Steady State)]].
- **Adaptations:** Improved cardiovascular function (↑Qmax, ↑SV, ↑blood volume), increased mitochondrial density/function, increased capillary density, enhanced fat oxidation capacity, improved lactate clearance (related to [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], [[E12. Lactate Threshold Training]]).
- **Goal:** Improve cardiorespiratory endurance, health markers, fat utilization, recovery capacity.

**Anaerobic Training:**
- **Definition:** Exercise performed at high intensities where ATP demand exceeds the capacity of the oxidative system, relying heavily on ATP-PCr and Glycolytic systems ([[A6. Energy Systems (Detailed)]]). Typically sustainable only for short durations (<2-3 minutes).
- **Intensity:** High to maximal (e.g., > LT2/MLSS, Zone 5+ HR, RPE >7).
- **Examples:** Sprints, [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]], SIT, heavy resistance training sets.
- **Adaptations:** Increased capacity of ATP-PCr and glycolytic systems (enzyme activity, substrate stores), improved buffering capacity, enhanced recruitment of Type II muscle fibers, increased maximal strength/power.
- **Goal:** Improve speed, power, anaerobic capacity, high-intensity work tolerance.

**Interaction:** Most activities involve a mix of both systems. Training programs often incorporate both types depending on goals (see [[E4. Interval Training (General)]]).
