### **EXL-35: Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension (Single & Double Arm)**

**ID:** EXL-35-DB-OHTRIEXT **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise targeting the triceps, performed seated or standing, involving extending the elbow(s) from a flexed position behind the head while holding a dumbbell overhead. The overhead position places a significant stretch on the long head of the triceps.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at stretch/contraction, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Barbell Overhead Triceps Extension [[EXL-13 Barbell Skullcrusher (Lying Triceps Extension)]] (can be done overhead too).
- Cable Overhead Triceps Extension [[EXL-68 Cable Overhead Triceps Extension (RopeBar)]] (constant tension).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Triceps Pushdowns [[EXL-67 Cable Triceps Pushdown (RopeBar)]].
- Triceps Kickbacks [[EXL-34 Dumbbell Triceps Kickback]].
- Resistance Band Overhead Triceps Extension [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Perform seated with back support for more stability.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Triceps Brachii (long head highly emphasized due to shoulder flexion).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anconeus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup (Double Arm):** Sit or stand upright, core engaged. Hold one dumbbell vertically with both hands cupped under the top end (diamond grip). Raise dumbbell directly overhead, arms fully extended.
- **Setup (Single Arm):** Sit or stand upright, core engaged. Hold one dumbbell in one hand, raise directly overhead, arm fully extended. Use non-working hand to support elbow of working arm if needed.
- **Execution:** Keeping upper arm(s) vertical and close to head (avoid excessive elbow flare), inhale and lower dumbbell behind head by bending only at the elbow(s). Lower as far as mobility allows, feeling a stretch in triceps. Exhale and extend elbow(s) fully, pressing dumbbell back to starting overhead position. Focus on triceps contraction. Keep upper arm(s) stable throughout.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering (eccentric), exhale during extension (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Flaring elbows excessively, moving upper arms (using shoulders), incomplete range of motion (not getting full stretch or extension), arching lower back (if standing without core brace).

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute elbow or shoulder injuries (impingement). Requires adequate shoulder flexion mobility.
- **Safety:** Control the weight carefully, especially when lowering behind head. Keep elbows from flaring excessively to protect shoulder joint. Use appropriate weight allowing strict form. Seated version offers more stability.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (stable upper arms, elbow position, control) [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]
