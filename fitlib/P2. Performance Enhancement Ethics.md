### P2. Performance Enhancement Ethics
**ID:** P2-PERFORMANCE-ENHANCEMENT
**Created:** 2025-04-25

The use of substances or methods to enhance athletic performance raises significant ethical considerations related to fairness, health risks, autonomy, and the "spirit of sport." (Expands on [[C24. Ergogenic Aids]]).

**Categories of Performance Enhancement:**
- **Permitted & Generally Accepted:** Training methodologies, evidence-based nutrition strategies ([[C. Nutrition & Diet]]), safe/legal supplements with proven efficacy ([[C21. Evidence-Based Supplements (Group A)]]), psychological skills training ([[K3. Psychological Aspects of Elite Performance]]), appropriate equipment.
- **Permitted but Debated ("Gray Area"):** Some supplements with limited evidence ([[C22. Supplements with LimitedMixed Evidence (Group B)]]), advanced (legal) recovery modalities with unclear long-term effects, potentially extreme (legal) dietary manipulations. Ethical debate may center on potential long-term health risks or fairness if access is unequal.
- **Prohibited (Doping):** Use of substances or methods banned by sporting organizations (e.g., WADA - World Anti-Doping Agency). Includes anabolic steroids, peptide hormones (EPO, hGH), stimulants, blood doping, gene doping.

**Ethical Arguments Against Doping:**
1.  **Fairness & Equality:** Creates an uneven playing field, undermining the principle of fair competition based on natural talent and dedication.
2.  **Health Risks:** Many banned substances carry significant short-term and long-term health risks (cardiovascular, hepatic, endocrine, psychological). Violates principle of non-maleficence ([[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching]]).
3.  **Coercion & Pressure:** Athletes (especially younger ones) may feel pressured to dope to remain competitive if others are doing so, compromising autonomy.
4.  **Integrity & Spirit of Sport:** Seen as undermining the intrinsic values of sport, such as hard work, dedication, and celebrating natural human potential.
5.  **Role Modeling:** Elite athletes are role models; widespread doping sends negative message about health and ethics.

**Ethical Arguments For Permitting (or Liberalizing Rules on) Some Enhancement Methods (Often Controversial):**
1.  **Autonomy:** Competent adult athletes should have the right to make informed decisions about their own bodies and risks, provided they don't harm others.
2.  **Arbitrary Lines:** Difficulty in drawing clear lines between "natural" advantages (genetics, resources) and "artificial" enhancement (supplements, advanced training tech). Questioning whether current anti-doping rules are consistent or fair.
3.  **Harm Reduction:** Legalization/regulation could potentially reduce risks associated with black market substances and uncontrolled use.
4.  **Focus on Health:** Shift focus from policing specific substances to monitoring overall athlete health markers.
5.  **Leveling the Playing Field?:** Argument that regulated access could potentially reduce inequalities caused by illicit doping.

**Current Stance:** Major sporting bodies maintain strict anti-doping policies based primarily on principles of fair play, athlete health, and integrity of sport. Athletes are subject to testing and sanctions under the principle of strict liability (responsible for any banned substance found).
