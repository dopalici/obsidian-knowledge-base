### **EXL-72: Cable Front Raise**

**ID:** EXL-72-CEX-FRONTRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise using a low pulley cable machine [[B10. Machine Training]] to target the anterior (front) deltoids. Involves raising the arm(s) straight forward against the constant tension of the cable.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Attachment Variations (Bar, Rope, Single Handle).
- Single-Arm Cable Front Raise.
- Progress to Dumbbell Front Raise [[EXL-25 Dumbbell Front Raise]].
- Progress to Overhead Press variations [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]], [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Front Raise [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound pressing movements.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Anterior Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Pectoralis Major (clavicular head), Medial Deltoid, Serratus Anterior, Biceps Brachii (short head).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Trapezius, Rotator Cuff.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Attach desired handle (bar, rope, D-handle) to low pulley cable. Stand facing away from machine, grasp handle(s) with overhand or neutral grip. Take a step or two forward so cable is taut. Stand upright, core engaged, arms straight or slightly bent in front of thighs.
- **Execution:** Keeping arm(s) straight (slight constant elbow bend), exhale and raise handle(s) directly forward and upward until arm(s) are approximately parallel to the floor (shoulder height). Avoid leaning back or using momentum. Control the descent, inhaling as you slowly lower handle(s) back to starting position against cable tension.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Using momentum/body swing, excessive leaning back, bending elbows during raise, shrugging shoulders, raising weight too high, uncontrolled eccentric.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff, biceps tendinopathy).
- **Safety:** Use strict form, minimize momentum. Control the weight. Use appropriate load.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal momentum, control, stable torso) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
