### **EXL-85: Side Plank (Standard & Variations)**

**ID:** EXL-85-BW-SIDEPLANK **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** An isometric core stability exercise [[B19. Isometrics]] performed lying on one side, supporting the body on the forearm/hand and feet. Primarily targets the obliques and other lateral core stabilizers [[L4. Core Stability Training]], resisting lateral flexion of the spine.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (depending on variation and duration).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Hold Duration [[B19. Isometrics]].
- Stack Feet (reduces base of support).
- Lift Top Leg (increases challenge on supporting hip abductors/core).
- Add Arm Movements (e.g., reach through/up).
- Add Hip Dips (dynamic variation).
- Side Plank on Hand (straight arm, increases lever length).
- Add External Load (e.g., hold dumbbell on top hip).
- Star Side Plank.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Knee Side Plank (support on bottom knee bent at 90 degrees).
- Shorten Hold Durations.
- Perform with wider foot stance (if on feet).
- Focus on standard Plank [[EXL-84 Plank (Standard & Variations)]] or Bird Dog first [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Stabilizers:** Obliques (Internal & External - especially bottom side), Quadratus Lumborum (bottom side), Gluteus Medius/Minimus (bottom leg).
- **Secondary Stabilizers:** Transverse Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis, Erector Spinae, Latissimus Dorsi, Deltoids (supporting shoulder), Adductors (top leg).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie on side, legs straight. Place bottom forearm on floor, elbow directly under shoulder. Place top hand on hip or extend towards ceiling. Engage core.
- **Execution:** Lift hips off floor until body forms a straight line from head to feet. Avoid letting hips sag towards floor or pike upwards. Keep head/neck in line with spine. Hold isometrically, maintaining tension in lateral core. Breathe steadily. Complete hold/reps for one side before switching.
- **Breathing:** Maintain steady, controlled breathing throughout the hold.
- **Common Faults:** Hips sagging, hips rotating forward/backward, shoulder creeping towards ear, head position incorrect.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder pain/injury (on supporting side), acute hip or back pain. Modify based on individual limitations.
- **Safety:** Ensure elbow/hand is directly under shoulder. Maintain straight body line. Stop if form breaks down or pain occurs.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Max hold time with good form [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Ability to maintain form during variations (e.g., leg raise).
- Qualitative assessment of body alignment and stability [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
