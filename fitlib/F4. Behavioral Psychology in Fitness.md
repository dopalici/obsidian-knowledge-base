Understanding and applying principles from behavioral psychology is fundamental for promoting initiation, adherence, and long-term maintenance of fitness-related behaviors (exercise, nutrition, recovery practices). It addresses the "why" and "how" of behavior change, complementing physiological knowledge.

**Key Psychological Theories & Models Guiding Fitness Behavior:**
1.  **Self-Determination Theory (SDT):** Focuses on the quality of motivation. Posits that fulfilling three basic psychological needs fosters more autonomous (intrinsic, self-determined) motivation, which predicts greater persistence and well-being:
    - *Autonomy:* Feeling volitional, having choice and control.
    - *Competence:* Feeling effective and capable in one's actions ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]] provides feedback).
    - *Relatedness:* Feeling connected to and supported by others. ([Deci & Ryan, 2000; Teixeira et al., 2012]).
2.  **Social Cognitive Theory (SCT):** Emphasizes reciprocal determinism (interaction between behavior, personal factors, environment). Key personal factor is *Self-Efficacy* - belief in one's capability to perform a specific behavior successfully in specific situations. Influenced by mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, physiological/affective states (Bandura, 1997). Outcome expectations (beliefs about consequences) also important.
3.  **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):** Behavioral *intention* is the immediate precursor to behavior. Intention is predicted by:
    - *Attitude:* Positive/negative evaluation of performing the behavior.
    - *Subjective Norms:* Perceived social approval/disapproval.
    - *Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC):* Perceived ease or difficulty (similar to self-efficacy). ([Ajzen, 1991]).
4.  **Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change - TTM):** Individuals move through stages of readiness: Precontemplation (no intention), Contemplation (thinking about it), Preparation (planning to start), Action (<6 months adherence), Maintenance (>6 months adherence). Tailoring intervention strategies (Processes of Change) to stage is key. Decisional balance (pros/cons) and self-efficacy vary across stages. ([Prochaska & DiClemente]).
5.  **Health Belief Model (HBM):** Behavior depends on perceived susceptibility to a health threat, perceived severity of the threat, perceived benefits of action, perceived barriers to action, cues to action, and self-efficacy.
6.  **Habit Formation Models:** Focus on developing automaticity through cue-routine-reward loops and repetition in stable contexts ([[N3. Building Sustainable Fitness Habits]]). Emphasizes environmental structuring and reducing friction. ([Gardner et al., 2012]).

**Evidence-Based Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs):** Specific, replicable components used in interventions (Michie et al., 2013 BCT Taxonomy v1):
- *Goals & Planning:* Goal setting (behavior/outcome), Problem solving, Action planning (specifying when/where/how), Implementation intentions ("if-then" plans), Review goals.
- *Feedback & Monitoring:* Self-monitoring (tracking activity, food, weight, etc.), Providing feedback on performance/outcomes.
- *Social Support:* Providing/facilitating practical, emotional, or appraisal support.
- *Shaping Knowledge:* Providing information on health consequences, benefits, how to perform behavior.
- *Association & Cues:* Using prompts, restructuring environment to add cues for desired behavior or remove cues for undesired behavior.
- *Repetition & Substitution:* Prompting habit formation through practice, substituting undesired behaviors.
- *Reward & Reinforcement:* Using incentives, self-rewards, verbal praise for effort/progress.
- *Regulation:* Stress management techniques ([[M3. Stress Management and Performance]]), relapse prevention strategies ([[D3. Weight Maintenance After Loss]]), managing emotions without using food/inactivity.
- *Identity:* Encouraging self-reevaluation, identifying as an active/healthy person.

**Practical Applications:** Designing fitness programs/interventions incorporating BCTs tailored to individual's stage of change, motivation type, self-efficacy level, and identified barriers enhances adherence and long-term success ([[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]]). Requires understanding the individual's psychological landscape alongside their physiology.
