### **EXL-94: Stationary Bike (Recumbent)**

**ID:** EXL-94-CARDIO-BIKERECUMBENT **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A cardiovascular exercise machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] where the rider is seated in a reclined position with back support, pedaling with legs out in front. Offers a low-impact workout with greater comfort and back support compared to upright bikes [[E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)]].

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (adjustable resistance/speed/duration).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Resistance Level [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Cadence (RPM) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Resistance Level.
- Decrease Cadence (RPM).
- Decrease Duration.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Systems:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]].
- **Primary Muscles Worked:** Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Calves. Glute involvement is typically less than upright cycling due to reclined position.
- **Stabilizers:** Minimal core stabilization required due to back support [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[E7. Cycling (Technique, Programming)]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat position so there is a slight bend in the knee when the leg is fully extended on the pedal. Sit back comfortably against the back support. Grip handles lightly.
- **Execution:** Pedal with smooth, circular motion. Maintain contact with back support. Adjust resistance/cadence as desired/programmed.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing.
- **Common Faults:** Seat too close/far, pedaling only with toes, insufficient resistance.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Generally very safe and well-tolerated, even for individuals with low back pain or balance issues due to the support provided. May still aggravate acute knee/hip injuries.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper seat adjustment. Start with lower resistance/duration. Stay hydrated [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Resistance Level, Cadence (RPM), Distance (estimated), Watts (if available) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
