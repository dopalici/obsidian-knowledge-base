### X11.8 Hamstring Injury Prevention in Sprinters
**ID:** X11.8-HAMSTRING-INJURY-PREVENTION
**Created:** 2025-04-26

Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are the most common acute injury in sprinting and many team sports involving sprinting. They typically occur during high-speed running, often during the late swing phase (terminal swing) or early stance phase, involving rapid eccentric loading as the hamstrings decelerate knee extension and initiate hip extension. Prevention requires a multi-faceted approach addressing modifiable risk factors.

**Risk Factors for HSIs:**
- **Previous HSI:** Strongest predictor of future HSI.
- **Strength Imbalances:** Weak hamstrings relative to quadriceps (low eccentric Ham:Quad ratio). Asymmetry between limbs. Weakness in specific hamstring muscles (e.g., Biceps Femoris long head often injured). Weakness in synergistic muscles (e.g., glutes).
- **Inadequate Eccentric Strength:** Poor ability of hamstrings to withstand high eccentric forces during terminal swing.
- **Poor Lumbopelvic Control / Core Stability:** Inadequate core stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]) can lead to altered pelvic positioning (e.g., excessive anterior tilt) increasing hamstring strain.
- **Limited Flexibility/Mobility:** Tight hip flexors or poor lumbo-pelvic rhythm can alter mechanics. However, excessive static stretching pre-activity may *increase* risk. Dynamic mobility important ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
- **Fatigue:** Neuromuscular fatigue alters coordination and reduces muscle force capacity, increasing injury risk, especially late in sessions/competitions.
- **Inadequate Warm-up:** Insufficient preparation of muscle tissue for high-intensity demands.
- **Training Load Errors:** Rapid increases in sprint volume/intensity without adequate adaptation ([[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]]).
- **Age:** Older athletes generally have higher risk.
- **Running Mechanics:** Potential contribution of specific kinematic factors (e.g., overstriding), though evidence less clear than strength/load factors.

**Evidence-Based Prevention Strategies:**
1.  **Eccentric Hamstring Strengthening:** Exercises targeting eccentric strength are highly effective.
    - *Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE):* Strong evidence for reducing HSI incidence across various sports ([van Dyk et al., 2019; Petersen et al., 2011]). Requires progressive overload and proper technique.
    - *Other Eccentrics:* Razor curls, single-leg RDLs with controlled eccentric phase.
2.  **Comprehensive Strength Training:** Include exercises targeting overall posterior chain (glutes, erectors), quadriceps, adductors, core stability. Address strength asymmetries between limbs. ([[X11.4 Strength Training Programming for Sprinters]]).
3.  **Lumbopelvic Control / Core Stability Training:** Enhance control over pelvis and trunk during high-speed movements.
4.  **Appropriate Training Load Management:** Gradual progression of sprint volume/intensity, adequate recovery, monitoring athlete readiness ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]).
5.  **Running Mechanics Assessment/Correction:** Address significant technical flaws that may increase strain (e.g., overstriding).
6.  **Adequate Warm-up & Mobility:** Include dynamic stretching and sprint-specific drills. Ensure adequate hip flexor/hamstring mobility through appropriate methods ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
