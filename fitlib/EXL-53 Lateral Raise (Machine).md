### **EXL-53: Lateral Raise (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-53-MEX-LATRAISE **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]] designed to target the medial (side) deltoids by abducting the arms against resistance pads. Provides stability and a fixed movement path.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Progress to Dumbbell Lateral Raises [[EXL-24 Dumbbell Lateral Raise]] or Cable Lateral Raises [[EXL-71 Cable Lateral Raise]] (require more stabilization/control).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Perform with lighter resistance bands [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Focus on compound shoulder exercises like Overhead Press [[EXL-05 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)]] / [[EXL-23 Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Seated)]] / [[EXL-52 Shoulder Press (Machine - Seated)]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Medial Deltoid.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Anterior Deltoid, Posterior Deltoid, Supraspinatus, Upper Trapezius (at top of ROM).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Scapular stabilizers.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Adjust seat height so shoulders align with machine's axis of rotation. Sit securely with back against pad, feet flat. Place outer arms/elbows against pads (depending on machine design). Grip handles lightly if available.
- **Execution:** Exhale and abduct arms, raising pads outwards and upwards until arms are approximately parallel to the floor (or as high as machine allows/is comfortable). Focus on leading with elbows/shoulders, not hands. Keep torso stable against pad. Pause briefly at top. Inhale and slowly lower pads back to starting position under control.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Shrugging shoulders excessively (using upper traps), leaning forward/using momentum, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled eccentric phase.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute shoulder injuries (impingement, rotator cuff issues). Ensure proper machine setup to avoid joint stress.
- **Safety:** Use appropriate weight allowing strict form. Control the movement. Avoid slamming weight stack.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (minimal shrugging, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
