A foundational understanding of the musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, muscles, connective tissues) is essential for comprehending movement and designing effective exercise programs.

**Key Components:**
- **Skeletal System (Bones):** Provides structural framework, protects organs, allows movement (via levers), stores minerals, produces blood cells. Major bones relevant to movement include femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius, ulna, pelvis, scapula, clavicle, vertebrae, ribs.
- **Joints (Articulations):** Junctions between two or more bones, allowing movement. Classified by structure (fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial) and function (synarthrosis - immovable, amphiarthrosis - slightly movable, diarthrosis - freely movable). Synovial joints (most common in limbs) characterized by joint capsule, synovial fluid, articular cartilage. Examples: Shoulder (ball-and-socket), Elbow (hinge), Hip (ball-and-socket), Knee (modified hinge), Ankle (hinge).
- **Muscular System (Skeletal Muscles):** Generate force to produce movement, maintain posture, stabilize joints, produce heat. Attach to bones via tendons. Composed of muscle fibers ([[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]]).
    - **Major Muscle Groups (Examples):**
        - *Lower Body:* Gluteals (maximus, medius, minimus), Quadriceps (rectus femoris, vasti), Hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), Adductors, Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus).
        - *Upper Body:* Pectorals (major, minor), Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius (upper, mid, lower), Rhomboids, Deltoids (anterior, middle, posterior), Rotator Cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis), Biceps Brachii, Triceps Brachii.
        - *Core:* Rectus Abdominis, Obliques (internal, external), Transverse Abdominis, Erector Spinae group, Multifidus, Quadratus Lumborum, Diaphragm, Pelvic Floor.
- **Connective Tissues:**
    - **Tendons:** Connect muscle to bone. Transmit tensile forces.
    - **Ligaments:** Connect bone to bone. Provide joint stability, limit excessive motion.
    - **Fascia:** Sheets of connective tissue surrounding muscles, groups of muscles, organs. Plays role in force transmission, proprioception.

**Understanding Origin, Insertion, Action:**
- **Origin:** Proximal attachment site of a muscle, usually considered the less movable point.
- **Insertion:** Distal attachment site, usually considered the more movable point.
- **Action:** The movement(s) produced when the muscle contracts concentrically (e.g., flexion, extension, abduction). Muscles often have multiple actions depending on joint position and stabilization.
