### **EXL-36: Dumbbell Lunge (Static/Alternating/Walking)**

**ID:** EXL-36-DB-LUNGE _(Note: This duplicates EXL-24 from the list, consolidating variations)_ **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A unilateral lower-body exercise involving stepping (or remaining static) and lowering the hips until both knees are bent near 90 degrees, while holding dumbbells. Develops single-leg strength, stability, balance, and hypertrophy. Includes variations like static (split squat), forward, reverse, and walking lunges.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires balance and coordination).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pauses at bottom, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Increase Stride Length (more glute/hamstring focus).
- Walking Lunges (adds dynamic/coordination challenge).
- Lateral Lunges (frontal plane).
- Overhead Dumbbell Lunge (increases core/shoulder stability).
- Barbell Lunges [[EXL-15 Barbell Lunge]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Bodyweight [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Static Split Squat (static position, easier balance) [[EXL-38 Dumbbell Split Squat]].
- Assisted Lunges (holding onto support).
- Shorter Range of Motion / Stride Length.
- Focus on balance exercises [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Quadriceps, Gluteus Maximus (of lead leg).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Hamstrings (lead leg), Adductor Magnus, Gluteus Medius/Minimus (hip stability).
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Calves, Muscles of the foot/ankle.

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides, feet hip-width apart, core engaged.
- **Execution (Forward Lunge):** Step forward moderately. Lower hips straight down until both knees near 90 degrees. Front knee tracks over foot, avoid excessive forward travel. Back knee hovers above floor. Upright torso. Push off front foot to return. Alternate legs or complete reps per side.
- **Execution (Reverse Lunge):** Step backward, lower hips until knees near 90 degrees. Drive through front foot to return. Often easier on knees.
- **Execution (Walking Lunge):** Step forward into lunge, then push off back foot and step _through_ into the next lunge with opposite leg.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during descent, exhale during ascent.
- **Common Faults:** Front knee collapsing inward (valgus), torso leaning too far forward/back rounding, pushing off back foot excessively in forward lunge, stepping too short/long, poor balance.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute knee or hip injuries, significant balance impairments. Reverse lunges or split squats may be better tolerated for some knee conditions.
- **Safety:** Master bodyweight version first. Ensure adequate space. Maintain control and balance.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load or bodyweight.
- Distance covered (walking lunges).
- Qualitative assessment of form (knee tracking, torso position, balance, depth) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
