### **EXL-09: Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**

**ID:** EXL-09-BB-RDL **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** A hip hinge exercise involving lowering a barbell towards the floor by pushing the hips back while maintaining a nearly straight leg position (slight knee bend) and a neutral spine. Primarily targets the hamstrings and glutes eccentrically and isometrically.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Requires good hip hinge mechanics and ability to maintain neutral spine).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]], Pause at bottom stretch).
- Single-Leg RDL [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] (requires more balance/stability).
- Good Morning [[EXL-10 Barbell Good Morning]] (bar on back, similar pattern).
- Conventional Deadlift [[EXL-03 Barbell Conventional Deadlift]] (full range pull from floor).

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Dumbbell RDL [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]].
- Kettlebell Swings/Deadlifts [[B9. Kettlebell Training]] (to practice hinge).
- Back Extensions [[EXL-19 Zercher Squat]].
- Glute Bridges / Hip Thrusts [[EXL-07 Barbell Hip Thrust]].
- Improve hamstring flexibility [[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]] and hip hinge pattern [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Hamstrings (eccentric/isometric emphasis), Gluteus Maximus (concentric hip extension).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Erector Spinae (isometric stabilization), Adductor Magnus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Upper Back (Latissimus Dorsi, Traps, Rhomboids - keep bar close, prevent rounding), Forearm flexors (grip). [[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding barbell with overhand grip just outside thighs. Knees slightly bent ("soft knees") but remain relatively fixed throughout movement. Maintain neutral spine, chest up, shoulders back.
- **Execution:** Initiate movement by pushing hips backward (hinging at the hip [[L1. Movement Patterns and Functional Training]]) while keeping back straight. Lower bar by sliding it down thighs/shins, keeping it close to the body. Lower as far as hamstring flexibility allows _while maintaining neutral spine_ (typically bar reaches mid-shin or slightly below knee). Feel stretch in hamstrings. Drive hips forward forcefully to return to starting position, squeezing glutes at the top. Avoid locking knees during descent; maintain slight bend. Movement is primarily hip hinge, not a squat.
- **Breathing:** Inhale during lowering/hinge (eccentric), exhale during hip extension (concentric).
- **Common Faults:** Rounding lower back, bending knees excessively (turning it into a squat), letting bar drift away from body, hyperextending back at top, initiating movement by bending spine.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute low back injury (disc issues, strains), acute hamstring strain. Requires good hamstring flexibility and ability to maintain spinal neutrality [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications.md]].
- **Safety:** Master hip hinge pattern first. Prioritize neutral spine. Keep bar close. Control eccentric phase. Don't force range of motion beyond hamstring flexibility while maintaining flat back.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip hinge quality, spinal neutrality, bar path, depth based on flexibility).
