### G-VII-2. Kinesiology: Movement Analysis
**ID:** G-VII-2-KINESIOLOGY
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Kinesiology is the study of human movement, integrating anatomy ([[G-VII-1. Musculoskeletal Anatomy Overview]]), physiology ([[A7. Muscle Physiology Fundamentals]]), and biomechanics ([[A11. Biomechanics Levers in the Human Body]] onwards). Analyzing movement involves understanding planes, axes, joint actions, and muscle roles.

**Planes of Motion:** Imaginary flat surfaces dividing the body:
- **Sagittal Plane:** Divides body into left and right halves. Movements: Flexion (decreasing joint angle), Extension (increasing joint angle), Dorsiflexion/Plantarflexion (ankle). Examples: Squats, bicep curls, running (primarily).
- **Frontal Plane (Coronal Plane):** Divides body into front (anterior) and back (posterior) halves. Movements: Abduction (away from midline), Adduction (towards midline), Lateral Flexion (spine), Eversion/Inversion (foot). Examples: Lateral raises, side lunges, jumping jacks.
- **Transverse Plane (Horizontal Plane):** Divides body into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) halves. Movements: Rotation (internal/external), Horizontal Abduction/Adduction (shoulder/hip), Pronation/Supination (forearm). Examples: Cable woodchops, throwing, swinging a bat/club.

**Axes of Rotation:** Lines around which movement occurs, perpendicular to the plane of motion:
- **Sagittal Axis:** Runs front to back (associated with frontal plane movements).
- **Frontal Axis:** Runs side to side (associated with sagittal plane movements).
- **Vertical Axis (Longitudinal Axis):** Runs top to bottom (associated with transverse plane movements).

**Joint Actions:** Specific movements occurring at synovial joints (e.g., flexion/extension at elbow, abduction/adduction at shoulder, internal/external rotation at hip).

**Muscle Roles During Movement:**
- **Agonist (Prime Mover):** Muscle primarily responsible for causing a specific movement.
- **Antagonist:** Muscle that opposes the action of the agonist. Relaxes or eccentrically controls movement.
- **Synergist:** Muscle that assists the agonist in producing the movement or stabilizes intermediate joints.
- **Stabilizer (Fixator):** Muscle that contracts isometrically to hold a body segment stationary, providing a stable base for movement elsewhere (e.g., core muscles during limb movements - [[L4. Core Stability Training]]).

**Analysis of Common Exercises:** Applying these concepts allows breakdown of exercises like squats (sagittal plane hip/knee flexion/extension), bench press (transverse plane horizontal adduction, sagittal plane shoulder flexion/extension, elbow extension), rows (sagittal/transverse plane shoulder extension/horizontal abduction, scapular retraction), etc., identifying primary movers, stabilizers, and joint actions involved.
