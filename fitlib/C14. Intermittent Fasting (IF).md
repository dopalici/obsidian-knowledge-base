**ID:** C14-INTERMITTENT-FASTING **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

Intermittent Fasting (IF) refers to eating patterns involving cycles of voluntary fasting and non-fasting (eating window). It dictates _when_ to eat, rather than _what_ specific foods to eat.

**Common Methods:**

- **Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF):** Daily cycles limiting eating to a specific window (e.g., 16/8: 16-hour fast, 8-hour eating window; other common variants include 14/10, 18/6, 20/4 or One-Meal-A-Day/OMAD).
- **Alternate-Day Fasting (ADF):** Alternating between days of normal eating ("feast" days) and days of complete fasting or very low calorie intake (~500 kcal or <25% of needs - "modified" ADF).
- **Periodic Fasting (e.g., 5:2 Diet):** Eating normally on most days (e.g., 5 days/week) with severe calorie restriction or full fasting on 2 non-consecutive days.

**Proposed Benefits & Mechanisms:**

- **Weight Loss:** IF methods can facilitate weight loss, primarily by helping individuals create a caloric deficit through the restriction of eating opportunities []. When calories and protein are matched, IF generally does not show superior weight loss or body composition changes compared to continuous calorie restriction [].
- **Metabolic Health:** Some studies suggest potential improvements in insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and oxidative stress markers, although results are not always consistent and may depend on the IF protocol and whether weight loss occurs.
- **Cellular Processes (Autophagy):** Fasting periods stimulate autophagy, a cellular 'clean-up' process. The relevance and magnitude of this effect with typical human IF protocols compared to continuous restriction or exercise effects are still under investigation.
- **Convenience/Simplicity:** Some individuals find limiting eating windows simplifies dietary management.

**Fitness & Performance Considerations:**

- **Training Performance:** Training in a fasted state (common with TRF protocols like 16/8 if training occurs before the eating window) may impair performance in high-intensity or prolonged exercise due to lower glycogen availability. However, performance can generally be maintained if adequate energy and macronutrients are consumed within the eating window []. Effects are highly individual.
- **Muscle Gain/Retention:** Achieving adequate protein intake [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]] and distributing it effectively within a compressed eating window can be challenging, potentially making IF suboptimal for maximizing muscle hypertrophy [[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]] compared to more frequent feedings. Consuming sufficient total daily protein remains key for LBM retention during fat loss [[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]].
- **Adherence:** Suitability varies greatly. Can conflict with social eating patterns or demanding training schedules. Potential initial side effects include hunger, headache, fatigue, irritability.
