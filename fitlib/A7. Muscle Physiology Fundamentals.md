Understanding skeletal muscle structure and function is key to exercise science.

**Muscle Structure:** Fibers (cells) -> Myofibrils -> Sarcomeres (Actin & Myosin contractile proteins). Connective tissue (Epimysium, Perimysium, Endomysium) transmits force.

**Muscle Contraction (Sliding Filament Theory):** Neural Signal (ACh) -> Excitation (Sarcolemma/T-tubules) -> Calcium Release (SR) -> Cross-Bridge Formation (Actin-Myosin binding via Troponin/Tropomyosin shift) -> Power Stroke (Myosin pulls Actin, uses ATP) -> Detachment (ATP binds Myosin) -> Reactivation (ATP hydrolysis) -> Relaxation (Calcium pumped back to SR).

**Contraction Types:**
- **Isometric:** Force produced, length constant (e.g., plank).
- **Concentric:** Muscle shortens while producing force (e.g., lifting phase).
- **Eccentric:** Muscle lengthens while producing force (e.g., lowering phase). Highest force potential, causes most damage ([[B20. Eccentric Training]]).

**Muscle Fiber Types:** Classified by MHC isoform (I, IIa, IIx).
- **Type I (Slow-Twitch Oxidative):** Fatigue resistant, aerobic, lower force/power. Recruited first.
- **Type IIa (Fast-Twitch Oxidative-Glycolytic):** Intermediate properties.
- **Type IIx (Fast-Twitch Glycolytic):** Highly fatigable, highest force/power, anaerobic. Recruited last/at high intensity.
- *Ratio largely genetic, some adaptation possible ([[A20. Principle of Specificity (SAID)]]).*
