### M2. Overtraining and Functional Overreaching
**ID:** M2-OVERTRAINING-SYNDROME
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Understanding the continuum from appropriate training stress to maladaptive states like Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) is crucial for optimizing long-term progress and athlete health.

**The Stress-Recovery-Adaptation Continuum:**
1.  **Acute Fatigue:** Normal fatigue experienced during/immediately after a training session. Performance temporarily decreased, recovers within hours.
2.  **Functional Overreaching (FOR):** Intentional, short-term increase in training load causing temporary performance decrement (days to ~1-2 weeks) followed by supercompensation (improved performance) after a brief recovery/taper period. Often planned part of periodization ([[K2. Advanced Periodization Strategies]]).
3.  **Non-Functional Overreaching (NFOR):** Excessive training stress leading to performance stagnation or decrement lasting weeks to months, often accompanied by increased psychological and/or neuroendocrine symptoms. Requires longer recovery period. No supercompensation occurs. Represents point where athlete has pushed too far.
4.  **Overtraining Syndrome (OTS):** A severe maladaptive state caused by prolonged imbalance between total stress (training + non-training) and recovery. Characterized by long-term performance decrement (>months), significant physiological dysfunction (neuroendocrine, immune), and pervasive psychological symptoms (fatigue, mood disturbance). Diagnosis of exclusion, requires ruling out underlying medical conditions (e.g., infection, anemia, [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]). Recovery can take many months or even years.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **FOR vs. NFOR/OTS:** Key difference is duration of performance decrement and recovery time needed. FOR is planned and leads to improvement; NFOR/OTS are unplanned maladaptations.
- **NFOR vs. OTS:** OTS represents more severe end of spectrum with multi-system dysfunction and longer recovery time. Distinction can be difficult clinically.

**Signs & Symptoms Suggesting NFOR/OTS (Highly Individualized):**
- **Performance:** Unexplained, persistent decrease in performance despite continued training. Increased perceived exertion (RPE) for same workload.
- **Physiological:** Persistent fatigue (central/peripheral), altered resting HR (can be ↑ or ↓), decreased HRV, sleep disturbances, frequent illness (suppressed immunity), loss of appetite/weight changes, hormonal changes (e.g., ↓Testosterone:Cortisol ratio, though variable).
- **Psychological:** Persistent high fatigue ratings, depressed mood, apathy, irritability, loss of motivation, concentration difficulties.

**Prevention Strategies:**
- **Appropriate Training Load Management:** Gradual progression ([[B1. Progressive Overload]]), planned periodization ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]), avoiding excessive/rapid increases in volume/intensity. Monitoring load (external/internal - [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]).
- **Adequate Recovery:** Prioritizing sleep ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]), nutrition (esp. energy availability - [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]), rest days/deloads (related to [[A26. Principle of Recovery]]).
- **Monitoring:** Tracking performance, subjective well-being (wellness questionnaires), physiological markers (RHR, HRV trends) to detect early signs of excessive stress.
- **Stress Management:** Managing total life stress (training + non-training - [[M3. Stress Management and Performance]]).
- **Individualization:** Recognizing individual tolerance and recovery capacity ([[A23. Principle of Individuality]]).
