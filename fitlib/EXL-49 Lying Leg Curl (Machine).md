### **EXL-49: Lying Leg Curl (Machine)**

**ID:** EXL-49-MEX-LEGCURL-LYING **Created:** 2025-04-30

**(Brief Description):** An isolation exercise performed lying prone on a machine [[B10. Machine Training]], involving flexing the knees against resistance provided by a lever arm. Primarily targets the hamstring muscles, potentially allowing for greater hip extension compared to the seated version.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner.

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Weight Stack) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (pause at peak contraction, slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Single-Leg Lying Leg Curl.
- Seated Leg Curl (Machine) [[EXL-48 Seated Leg Curl (Machine)]].
- Progress to free weight exercises like RDLs [[EXL-09 Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]] / [[EXL-37 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)]], Glute-Ham Raises [[EXL-87 Glute-Ham Raise (GHR)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load.
- Resistance Band Hamstring Curls [[B11. Resistance Bands]].
- Stability Ball Hamstring Curls [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Glute Bridges [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Hamstrings (Biceps Femoris - short & long heads, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus).
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Gastrocnemius (assists knee flexion), Popliteus, Sartorius, Gracilis.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Glutes, Erector Spinae (to maintain prone position).

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Lie face down (prone) on the machine pad, aligning knees just off the edge of the pad and near the machine's axis of rotation. Place the back of the lower legs/ankles securely under the roller pad. Grip handles in front for stability. Keep hips pressed into the pad.
- **Execution:** Exhale and flex knees, curling the roller pad towards glutes smoothly. Focus on contracting the hamstrings. Avoid lifting hips significantly off the pad (maintaining slight hip extension is okay). Pause briefly at peak contraction. Inhale and slowly lower the pad back to the starting position under control (eccentric phase).
- **Breathing:** Exhale during knee flexion (concentric), inhale during knee extension (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Lifting hips excessively off pad, using momentum/swinging legs, incomplete range of motion, uncontrolled eccentric phase.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute hamstring strain, significant knee injury. May cause discomfort for some individuals with low back pain due to prone position.
- **Safety:** Ensure proper alignment on machine. Keep hips down. Control the weight throughout the movement. Avoid hyperextending knees at the bottom.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load.
- Qualitative assessment of form (hip stability, control, ROM) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
