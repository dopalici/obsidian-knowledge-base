### **EXL-91: Treadmill (Walking/Running)**

**ID:** EXL-91-CARDIO-TREADMILL **Created:** 2025-05-01

**(Brief Description):** A common cardiovascular exercise machine [[VIII-2. Commercial Gym Equipment.md]] that allows users to walk, jog, or run indoors on a moving belt. Offers control over speed and incline.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Advanced (depending on speed, incline, duration).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Speed [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Incline [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Duration [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Incorporate Interval Training [[E4. Interval Training (General)]] / [[E3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)]].
- Reduce reliance on handrails.

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Speed.
- Decrease Incline.
- Decrease Duration.
- Use handrails for balance support initially.
- Progress from walking to jogging to running.

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers:** Cardiovascular System [[A8. Cardiovascular Physiology Fundamentals]], Respiratory System [[A9. Respiratory Physiology Fundamentals]]. Lower Body Muscles (Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves) dynamically involved.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[E6. Running (Technique, Programming)]], [[A16. Biomechanics Gait Analysis]]

- **Setup:** Stand on side rails, select program or manual mode, start belt at slow speed. Step onto moving belt carefully.
- **Execution:** Walk, jog, or run maintaining natural gait. Keep posture upright, core engaged, look forward. Avoid excessive gripping of handrails (use lightly for balance only if necessary). Adjust speed/incline as desired/programmed.
- **Breathing:** Maintain rhythmic breathing.
- **Common Faults:** Holding handrails excessively (reduces effort/alters gait), looking down, stomping feet, overstriding.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute lower limb injuries (knee, ankle, hip), severe balance issues, certain cardiovascular conditions may require clearance [[IX-6 Exercise Contraindications.md]], [[Q5. Exercise Considerations for Health Conditions Overview]]. Impact can aggravate some joint conditions.
- **Safety:** Use safety clip/key. Start belt slowly before stepping on. Know how to perform emergency stop. Stay aware of belt movement when getting on/off. Maintain hydration [[C4. Hydration]].

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Duration, Distance, Speed, Incline [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Heart Rate Response [[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]].
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).
- Calorie estimates (use very cautiously - often inaccurate [[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]).
