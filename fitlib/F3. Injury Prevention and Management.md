**ID:** F3-INJURY-PREVENTION
**Created:** 2025-04-24 (Expanded 2025-04-26)

Injury prevention involves implementing proactive strategies based on understanding risk factors to reduce the likelihood of musculoskeletal injuries. Injury management focuses on optimal care after an injury occurs to facilitate healing and safe return to activity. (Expands on [[IX-2. Injury Prevention Strategies]] and [[IX-3. Basic Injury Management (Acute Phase)]]).

**Injury Prevention Strategies (Multifaceted Approach):**
1.  **Training Load Management:** The most significant modifiable risk factor. Requires careful planning and monitoring of training volume, intensity, and frequency changes. Gradual progression ([[B1. Progressive Overload]]) is key. Avoid large, rapid spikes in load. Monitor internal/external load and recovery ([[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]). Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) can be a useful *monitoring* tool (interpret with caution, context matters) ([Gabbett, 2016; Murray et al., 2017]).
2.  **Strength Training:** Improves tissue capacity (muscle, tendon, bone, ligament resilience). Addresses muscle imbalances. Specific exercises (e.g., Nordic hamstring exercise, Copenhagen adduction exercise, rotator cuff strengthening) proven effective for preventing specific injuries (hamstring strains, groin injuries, shoulder issues). Crucial for all athletes, including endurance athletes ([[X1.1. Strength Training for Runners]]). ([Lauersen et al., 2014]).
3.  **Neuromuscular Training (Balance/Proprioception):** Enhances joint stability, dynamic postural control, landing mechanics, and reactive ability. Programs incorporating balance, plyometrics, and agility drills significantly reduce risk of lower limb injuries, particularly ACL tears and ankle sprains ([[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]]). ([Emery et al., 2015]).
4.  **Technique/Biomechanics:** Mastering efficient and safe movement patterns for sport-specific skills and lifting reduces aberrant stress on tissues ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]). Requires quality coaching and practice.
5.  **Mobility & Flexibility:** Addressing significant limitations in task-relevant range of motion can prevent compensatory movements that increase stress elsewhere ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]). However, excessive flexibility (hypermobility) can also be a risk factor in some contexts.
6.  **Warm-up:** Prepares tissues for demands of activity, potentially reducing risk of acute muscle strains ([[F2. Performance Optimization Factors]]).
7.  **Recovery:** Prioritizing sleep ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]) and nutrition (especially adequate Energy Availability - [[I3. Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)]]) is critical for tissue repair and preventing fatigue-related injuries.
8.  **Equipment:** Appropriate, well-maintained footwear and protective gear relevant to the sport ([[VIII-5. Apparel & Footwear]]).
9.  **Screening:** Identifying individuals with high-risk factors (e.g., previous injury history - strongest predictor, significant movement asymmetries/limitations - [[A17. Movement Screening]]) allows for targeted interventions.

**Injury Management (Acute Phase & Beyond):**
- **Initial Management (PEACE & LOVE - [[IX-3. Basic Injury Management (Acute Phase)]]):** Emphasizes Protection, Elevation, Avoiding Anti-inflammatories (potentially), Compression, Education initially, followed by Optimal Loading, Optimism, Vascularisation, and Exercise. Aims to manage symptoms while promoting early, controlled loading to stimulate healing.
- **Rehabilitation Principles ([[IX-5. Introduction to Rehabilitation Principles]]):** Structured, progressive program guided by tissue healing phases and functional criteria. Focuses on restoring ROM, strength, neuromuscular control, proprioception, and sport-specific function. Requires patience and adherence. Collaboration with healthcare professionals (PT, AT, MD) essential.
- **Return to Sport/Activity:** Criteria-based decision process involving pain levels, ROM, strength measures, functional tests, sport-specific skill performance, psychological readiness. Gradual re-introduction to training load is crucial to prevent re-injury.
