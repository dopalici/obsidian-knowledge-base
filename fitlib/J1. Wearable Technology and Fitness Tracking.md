Wearable fitness technology (fitness trackers, smartwatches, heart rate monitors, GPS devices) provides accessible data for monitoring activity levels, physiological responses, and sleep patterns. While potentially useful tools for motivation and tracking trends, users should be aware of their limitations regarding accuracy and interpretation.

**Commonly Tracked Metrics & Applications:**
- **Step Counting:** Quantifies daily ambulatory activity, useful for monitoring general activity levels and NEAT (related to [[A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)]]). Accuracy varies with activity type.
- **Heart Rate (HR) Monitoring:**
    - *Optical (PPG):* Wrist/arm based. Accuracy variable, better at rest/steady state.
    - *Chest Straps (ECG):* Gold standard for exercise accuracy.
    - *Applications:* Intensity monitoring ([[E13. Heart Rate Zone Training]]), RHR trends, EE estimation (inaccurate).
- **Sleep Tracking:** Estimates duration/stages using accelerometers/HR. Duration estimate reasonable, stage accuracy low-moderate vs. polysomnography. Useful for pattern analysis ([[F1. Sleep Quality and Quantity]]).
- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Reflects autonomic balance. Requires accurate R-R intervals (chest strap preferred). Use trends relative to baseline for recovery insights (related to [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]]).
- **GPS Tracking:** Tracks distance/speed/pace outdoors. Accuracy good in open areas.
- **Energy Expenditure Estimation:** Often highly inaccurate; use with extreme caution.

**Best Practices for Use:**
- Focus on trends over absolute values.
- Understand accuracy limitations per metric/device.
- Combine with subjective measures (RPE, wellness).
- Use appropriate device for goal (chest strap for exercise HR).
- Avoid data obsession; use as a tool.
