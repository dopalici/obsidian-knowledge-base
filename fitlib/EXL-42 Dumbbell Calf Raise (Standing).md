### **EXL-42: Dumbbell Calf Raise (Standing)**

**ID:** EXL-42-DB-CALFRAISE-STAND **Created:** 2025-04-29

**(Brief Description):** An exercise targeting the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) through ankle plantarflexion while standing and holding dumbbells. Allows for independent loading of each leg's stabilizers compared to machine or barbell versions.

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Balance can be a factor).

**Progression Path(s):**

- Increase Load (Dumbbell Weight) [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- Increase Reps/Sets [[B5. Training Volume and Frequency]].
- Tempo Variations (Pause at top/bottom, Slow eccentric [[B20. Eccentric Training]]).
- Perform on one leg (Single-Leg Dumbbell Calf Raise - significantly increases balance/load demand).
- Increase Range of Motion (stand on edge of step/plate).
- Barbell Calf Raise [[EXL-20 Barbell Calf Raise]].
- Standing Calf Raise Machine [[EXL-61 Calf Raise (Machine - Standing)]].

**Regression Path(s):**

- Decrease Load / Use Bodyweight [[B7. Bodyweight Training]].
- Perform with hand support for balance.
- Reduce Range of Motion initially.
- Seated Calf Raises [[EXL-62 Calf Raise (Machine - Seated)]] (focuses on soleus, more stable).

**Target Muscles:**

- **Primary Movers (Agonists):** Gastrocnemius (emphasized with knee straight), Soleus.
- **Secondary Movers (Synergists):** Tibialis Posterior, Peroneus Longus/Brevis, Flexor Hallucis Longus, Flexor Digitorum Longus.
- **Stabilizers:** Core musculature [[L4. Core Stability Training]], Muscles controlling foot/ankle stability [[L3. Balance and Coordination Training]].

**Form Cues & Technique:** [[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]

- **Setup:** Stand upright holding dumbbells at sides. Place balls of feet firmly on floor (or preferably on an elevated surface like a plate/block for greater ROM), heels hanging off if elevated. Maintain upright posture, core engaged, knees straight or with very slight bend.
- **Execution:** Lower heels towards floor slowly, achieving a full stretch in calves. Push forcefully through balls of feet to raise heels as high as possible (plantarflexion), squeezing calves at top. Control the descent slowly back to the stretched position. Avoid using momentum.
- **Breathing:** Exhale during heel raise (concentric), inhale during lowering (eccentric).
- **Common Faults:** Bouncing at bottom, incomplete range of motion, bending knees significantly, poor balance, rolling ankles.

**Contraindications & Safety:**

- **Conditions:** Acute ankle sprains, Achilles tendinopathy/rupture (requires careful management), plantar fasciitis (may be aggravated by stretch). Balance issues require caution or support.
- **Safety:** Ensure stable footing, especially if using elevated surface. Control movement, avoid bouncing.

**Metrics for Assessment:**

- Load lifted (per dumbbell) for specific reps/sets [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
- Max reps at a given load or bodyweight.
- Qualitative assessment of form (control, ROM, balance) [[O2. Measuring Fitness Progress]].
