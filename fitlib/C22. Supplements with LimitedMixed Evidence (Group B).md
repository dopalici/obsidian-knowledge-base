**ID:** C22-SUPPLEMENTS-LIMITED-EVIDENCE **Created:** 2025-04-26 _(Content Revised)_

This category includes supplements with preliminary or conflicting scientific evidence regarding their efficacy for performance or recovery. More research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made. Their use should be considered on an individual basis, potentially under expert guidance, acknowledging the current limitations in evidence (aligns with AIS Group B / IOC 'Limited Evidence') [].

- **HMB (β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate):**
    - **Claim:** Anti-catabolic, may enhance recovery/hypertrophy.
    - **Evidence:** Mixed. Some studies show potential benefits (preserving LBM, slight strength gains) primarily in untrained individuals starting resistance training or during periods of very high stress/muscle damage (e.g., prolonged bed rest). Less convincing evidence in well-trained individuals engaging in standard resistance training. Free acid form (HMB-FA) might have better bioavailability than calcium salt (HMB-Ca).
- **Collagen Peptides/Hydrolyzed Collagen:**
    - **Claim:** Supports joint health, connective tissue repair, reduces joint pain.
    - **Evidence:** Emerging evidence suggests potential benefits for improving activity-related joint pain and possibly supporting connective tissue synthesis when combined with targeted exercise and Vitamin C. Requires specific protocols (e.g., timing relative to exercise). More high-quality, long-term research is needed on functional outcomes and optimal dosing [].
- **Fish Oil (Omega-3s - EPA/DHA):**
    - **Claim:** Reduces inflammation, aids recovery, potential performance benefits.
    - **Evidence:** Strong evidence for general cardiovascular health. For athletes, may help reduce DOMS perception and markers of inflammation post-exercise [[C33. Anti-Inflammatory FoodsDiets]]. Potential neuroprotective benefits in contact sports are being explored. Direct evidence for improving _performance_ metrics (e.g., endurance, strength) is less consistent, though some studies suggest benefits for endurance capacity []. Athletes are often at risk of inadequacy.
- **Probiotics:**
    - **Claim:** Improves gut health, immune function, reduces GI distress/URTIs in athletes.
    - **Evidence:** Highly strain-specific. Some evidence suggests certain strains may reduce the incidence/severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and potentially exercise-induced GI symptoms in athletes. However, results vary significantly between studies and strains [[C32. Gut Health and Microbiome]]. More research needed to identify optimal strains/doses for specific benefits.
- **Curcumin (from Turmeric):**
    - **Claim:** Anti-inflammatory, reduces muscle soreness.
    - **Evidence:** Some studies indicate potential for reducing markers of inflammation and DOMS following eccentric exercise. Bioavailability is a key limitation; often formulated with absorption enhancers (e.g., piperine). Evidence for direct performance enhancement is weak.
- **Citrulline (Malate or L-Citrulline):**
    - **Claim:** Enhances nitric oxide production, improves blood flow, performance, reduces soreness.
    - **Evidence:** Mixed. Some studies show improvements in resistance training performance (reps to failure) and reduced muscle soreness. Other meta-analyses find limited evidence for direct performance enhancement, particularly in endurance. L-Citrulline may be more effective than L-Arginine for increasing blood arginine levels.
- **Carnitine:**
    - **Claim:** Enhances fat oxidation, spares glycogen, improves performance/recovery.
    - **Evidence:** Generally ineffective for enhancing fat oxidation or performance in healthy individuals unless a deficiency exists. L-Carnitine L-Tartrate (LCLT) form has shown some minor potential benefits for recovery markers (e.g., reduced muscle damage markers, soreness) in some studies.
