### G3. Training with Health Limitations / Chronic Conditions
**ID:** G3-TRAINING-WITH-LIMITATIONS
**Created:** 2025-04-24

Exercise is generally beneficial and often recommended as part of management for many chronic health conditions, but requires specific considerations, modifications, and often medical clearance/guidance. Exercise prescription should be individualized based on the condition, severity, medications, and individual capacity.

**General Principles:**
- **Medical Clearance:** Often necessary before starting/significantly changing exercise program, especially for cardiovascular, metabolic, renal disease (related to [[IX-6. Exercise Contraindications]]).
- **Individualization:** Program must be tailored to the specific condition and individual's functional capacity.
- **Start Low, Progress Slow:** Begin with low intensity/duration, gradually increase as tolerated.
- **Monitor Symptoms:** Pay close attention to condition-specific warning signs and symptoms during/after exercise.
- **Medication Awareness:** Understand how medications may affect exercise response and timing.
- **Focus on Function & Quality of Life:** Goals often center on improving daily function, managing symptoms, reducing disease risk factors.

**Examples of Conditions & Considerations:**
- **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) / Hypertension:** Cardiac rehab often initial step. Moderate aerobic + resistance training beneficial. Monitor HR/BP/RPE. Avoid Valsalva if uncontrolled HTN.
- **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D):** Combine aerobic & resistance. Monitor blood glucose (hypoglycemia risk). Foot care.
- **Obesity:** High volume activity (>250 min/week) + resistance training. Low-impact options if joint pain.
- **Arthritis (OA/RA):** Low-impact aerobic, strength training, ROM exercises. Exercise during lower inflammation periods.
- **Osteoporosis:** Weight-bearing aerobic, resistance training, balance exercises. Avoid spinal flexion/high-impact if severe. Ensure adequate Calcium/Vit D.
- **COPD:** Pulmonary rehab. Aerobic exercise limited by dyspnea. Resistance training beneficial. Breathing techniques.
- **Lower Back Pain (Non-specific):** Stay active. Aerobic conditioning. Core stability ([[L4. Core Stability Training]]). Mobility work. Proper mechanics ([[A18. Proper Lifting Mechanics]]).

**Professional Guidance:** Collaboration between healthcare providers (physicians, physical therapists) and qualified exercise professionals is often necessary to develop safe and effective programs. Scope of practice considerations crucial ([[P1. Ethical Training and Coaching]]).
