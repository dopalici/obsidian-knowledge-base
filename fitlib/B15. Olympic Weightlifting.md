### B15. Olympic Weightlifting
**ID:** B15-OLYMPIC-WEIGHTLIFTING
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Olympic weightlifting (often just "weightlifting") is a strength sport involving two dynamic, full-body barbell lifts: the Snatch and the Clean & Jerk. It requires exceptional strength, power, speed, flexibility, coordination, and balance.

**Competition Lifts:**
- **Snatch:** Floor to overhead lockout in one continuous, explosive movement (wide grip).
- **Clean & Jerk:** Floor to shoulders ("clean"), then shoulders to overhead lockout ("jerk" - split or push jerk typical).

**Training Principles:**
- **Technique Dominance:** Extremely high technical proficiency is paramount. Extensive practice required.
- **Power & Speed:** Emphasis on rate of force development (RFD) and explosive movement ([[B13. Strength Training Goals (Max Strength, Power, Hypertrophy, Endurance)]]).
- **Strength Foundation:** High levels of maximal strength (esp. squats, pulls, presses) are necessary prerequisites.
- **Mobility & Flexibility:** Requires exceptional mobility in shoulders, hips, ankles, thoracic spine ([[L2. Mobility and Flexibility Development]]).
- **Specificity:** Training heavily focused on snatch, clean & jerk variations, and related strength exercises (squats, pulls, presses).
- **Periodization:** Carefully planned to develop technique, strength, power, and peak for competitions ([[A25. Principle of Periodization]]).

**Common Assistance Exercises:** Power snatch, power clean, snatch pulls, clean pulls, front squats, overhead squats, push press, jerk variations.

**Considerations:** High technical barrier to entry. Requires specialized coaching and equipment (bumper plates, platform). High mobility demands.
