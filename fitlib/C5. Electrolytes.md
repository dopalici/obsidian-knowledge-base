### C5. Electrolytes

**ID:** C5-ELECTROLYTES **Created:** 2025-04-26

Electrolytes are critical minerals that play fundamental roles in physiological function, particularly in exercise performance, hydration, and cellular communication.

**Fundamental Electrolyte Roles:**

1. **Fluid Balance Regulation**
2. **Nerve Impulse Transmission**
3. **Muscle Contraction**
4. **pH Maintenance**
5. **Nutrient Transport**

**Primary Electrolytes:**

1. **Sodium (Na+):**
    
    - **Primary Characteristics:**
        - Highest concentration in extracellular fluid
        - Critical for fluid balance
        - Concentration varies: 20-80 mmol/L in sweat
    - **Research Insights:**
        - Baker et al. (2024, Sports Medicine) demonstrated:
            - Sodium drives thirst mechanism
            - Crucial for plasma volume maintenance
            - Individual sweat sodium concentration highly variable
2. **Potassium (K+):**
    
    - **Key Functions:**
        - Intracellular primary cation
        - Muscle and nerve cell function
        - Cardiac rhythm regulation
    - **Exercise Considerations:**
        - Significant loss through sweating
        - Lower concentration in sweat (4-8 mmol/L)
3. **Magnesium (Mg2+):**
    
    - **Physiological Roles:**
        - Enzyme activation
        - Muscle and nerve function
        - Energy production
    - **Athletic Significance:**
        - Often depleted through intense training
        - Crucial for recovery and performance
4. **Calcium (Ca2+):**
    
    - **Critical Functions:**
        - Muscle contraction
        - Bone health
        - Cellular signaling
    - **Exercise Implications:**
        - Lost in smaller quantities
        - Important for neuromuscular coordination

**Electrolyte Loss Mechanisms:**

- **Sweat Composition Factors:**
    1. Genetics
    2. Acclimatization status
    3. Exercise intensity
    4. Environmental conditions

**Performance and Health Implications:**

- **Hyponatremia Risks:**
    1. Potentially life-threatening condition
    2. Occurs from water overconsumption
    3. More common in prolonged endurance events

**Replacement Strategies:**

1. **During Prolonged Exercise (>60-90 minutes):**
    
    - Sodium intake: 300-600 mg/hour
    - Individual variation critical
    - Personalized approach recommended
2. **Electrolyte Beverage Considerations:**
    
    - Concentration: 400-800 mg Sodium/L
    - Multiple electrolyte sources preferred
    - Avoid excessive sugar content

**Individual Variability ([[A23. Principle of Individuality]]):**

- Sweat composition differs significantly
- Genetic factors influence electrolyte loss
- Professional testing can provide personalized insights

**Monitoring and Assessment:**

1. **Indicators of Electrolyte Imbalance:**
    
    - Muscle cramps
    - Fatigue
    - Headaches
    - Irregular heartbeat
2. **Assessment Methods:**
    
    - Sweat sodium concentration testing
    - Blood panel analysis
    - Subjective symptom tracking

**Special Population Considerations:**

- **Endurance Athletes ([[C27. Nutrition for Endurance Performance (Carb Loading)]]):**
    
    1. Higher replacement needs
    2. More complex electrolyte strategies
- **Team Sports Athletes ([[X4. Team Sports - General Considerations]]):**
    
    1. Intermittent high-intensity electrolyte loss
    2. Variable replacement requirements

**Technological Monitoring ([[VIII-3. Wearable Technology (Fitness Trackers, Smartwatches, HRMs)]]):**

- Emerging sweat analysis technologies
- Non-invasive electrolyte tracking
- Accuracy limitations persist

**Practical Recommendations:**

1. Individualized electrolyte replacement strategy
2. Professional consultation for precise needs
3. Regular monitoring and adjustment
