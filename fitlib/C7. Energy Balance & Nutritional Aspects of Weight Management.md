Effective weight management hinges on manipulating energy balance [[A1. Energy Balance]]—the relationship between energy intake (calories consumed) and energy expenditure (calories burned). Nutritional strategies are tailored to create the appropriate energy balance for achieving specific goals like fat loss, muscle gain, or weight maintenance [[D. Weight Management]].

**Core Principles Applied:**

- **Fat Loss ([[C26. Nutrition for Fat Loss]]):** Requires a sustained **negative energy balance (caloric deficit)**.
    - _Nutritional Strategy:_ Create a deficit (~10-25% below TDEE [[A2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)]]) primarily through dietary modification, while prioritizing high protein intake [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]] to preserve LBM [[H3. Realistic Fat Loss Rates]], adequate fiber [[A3. Macronutrients]] for satiety, sufficient micronutrients [[C6. Micronutrients (Detailed Roles & Considerations)]] via nutrient-dense foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]], and adequate hydration [[C4. Hydration]]. Exercise (especially resistance training [[B. Resistance Training]]) is crucial for LBM retention and increasing TDEE.
- **Muscle Gain ([[C25. Nutrition for Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy)]]):** Generally requires a sustained **positive energy balance (caloric surplus)**.
    - _Nutritional Strategy:_ Implement a modest surplus (~10-20% above TDEE) to provide energy for tissue building without excessive fat gain [[H2. Realistic Muscle Gain Rates]]. Requires high protein intake [[B2. Protein Requirements for Muscle Growth]], sufficient carbohydrates to fuel training [[A3. Macronutrients]], and appropriate fat intake, alongside a progressive resistance training stimulus [[B1. Progressive Overload]].
- **Weight Maintenance ([[D3. Weight Maintenance After Loss]]):** Requires achieving **average energy balance (EI ≈ EE)** over time.
    - _Nutritional Strategy:_ Consuming calories roughly equivalent to TDEE. Requires ongoing awareness and potential adjustments due to fluctuations in activity and possible metabolic adaptation [[C8. Metabolic Adaptation (Adaptive Thermogenesis)]]. Continued focus on diet quality, adequate protein, and regular physical activity helps maintain body composition and prevent regain.

**Key Nutritional Considerations Across Goals:**

- **Protein:** Plays a critical role in satiety (aiding deficit adherence), LBM preservation (during deficit), and building new muscle tissue (during surplus) [].
- **Food Quality:** Prioritizing nutrient-dense, whole, or minimally processed foods [[C30. Food Quality & Health (Whole vs Processed)]] supports health, satiety, and micronutrient intake regardless of the energy balance goal.
- **Adherence & Sustainability:** The most effective nutritional strategy is one that aligns with individual preferences, lifestyle, and cultural factors, allowing for long-term adherence [[D2. Diet Adherence and Behavior Change]]. Flexible approaches [[C18. Flexible Dieting (IIFYM - If It Fits Your Macros)]] often prove more sustainable than highly restrictive diets.
