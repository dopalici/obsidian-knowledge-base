### E5. Fartlek Training
**ID:** E5-FARTLEK
**Created:** 2025-04-23

Fartlek, Swedish for "speed play," is an unstructured form of interval training where intensity and duration of work/recovery periods are varied based on feel, terrain, or external cues, rather than fixed times or distances.

**Characteristics:**
- **Unstructured Intervals:** Intensity varies irregularly throughout the session. Faster bursts are mixed with periods of easier jogging/walking.
- **Continuous Movement:** Typically involves continuous running/cycling/etc., but at varying speeds.
- **Athlete-Driven:** Pace changes often dictated by how the athlete feels or by landmarks (e.g., "sprint to the next tree, jog to the lamppost").
- **Versatility:** Can be adapted to any terrain (road, trail, track).

**Benefits:**
- **Less Mentally Taxing:** Can be more enjoyable and less mentally demanding than strictly timed intervals.
- **Develops Pace Judgment:** Teaches athletes to tune into their perceived exertion and vary pace accordingly.
- **Simulates Race Conditions:** Irregular pacing mimics surges and changes often found in competitive races.
- **Combines Aerobic/Anaerobic Stimulus:** Provides stress across different intensity zones and energy systems.
- **Adaptability:** Can be easily modified based on fitness level, terrain, or training goals for the day.

**Implementation:** Typically performed as a continuous session (e.g., 30-60 minutes) where the athlete introduces bursts of higher intensity effort spontaneously within an overall aerobic run.

**Key Research:**
- (Fartlek is more of a training methodology than a heavily researched physiological intervention itself, often included within broader discussions of interval training).
- Daniels J. (2013). Daniels' Running Formula (3rd ed.). Human Kinetics. (Describes practical application of various training types including Fartlek).
